    "text": "Selling Is a Prerequisite for Life There are an estimated 18 million people in the United States alone who self-identify as salespeople. There are car salespeople. Real estate salespeople. Software salespeople. B2B salespeople. Door to door salespeople. There are inside salespeople. There are outside salespeople. Territory salespeople. Strategic accounts salespeople. Regional salespeople. Sales engineers... the list goes on and on. That's a lot of salespeople. In fact, nearly 13% of all the jobs in the U.S. (1 in 8) are full time sales positions. But the real total of salespeople, I would argue, far surpasses that number. Why? Because in today's business environment, EVERYONE needs to be a salesperson. Selling impacts EVERYONE on this planet. Your ability-or inability-to sell, persuade, negotiate, and convince others will affect every area of your life and will determine whether you survive or thrive. Here's why: No matter what your title or position is, or what your role is in a company or team, you will at some point have to convince others of something. If you're a manager or a CEO, you're a salesperson. And the better you understand the whole cycle, the more you'll get out of your role and the more you'll get out of your employees and or company. If you're a hairdresser, or an accountant, or a dog walker, you're a salesperson. The better you are at sales, the more repeat business you'll receive, the more referrals you'll get, and the more money you'll make. Lawyers, especially trial lawyers, are big-time salespeople. They have to sell to the judge and jury. If you're a parent... talk about having to master sales! Every day is a negotiation with your kids. When they're small, you have to negotiate with them about bedtime and screentime and why three is too young to have an iPhone. When they're older, you're basically negotiating similar things, you may have to sell them on the idea that college or a career is a much better choice than joining a band and driving around the country in a VW Bus. It never ends. Concepts such as discipline, work ethic, education, good manners, and homework all have to be sold. Think of the most successful people you know. Mark Cuban. Martha Stewart. Steve Jobs (when he was CEO of Apple). Bill Gates. Oprah Winfrey. These are masters who are so good at the skill of selling that they don't even look like they're selling. Take Oprah Winfrey. She looks like she's starting a book club, but she's selling. She's so good at selling that they've coined a name for it, they call it the \u201cOprah Effect.\u201d Every book she's chosen for her book club, and there's been about 80 so far, has gone on to be a best-seller. The \u201cOprah Effect\u201d has generated sales of more than 60 million copies of her book club's selections. Now that's a killer salesperson. 2."

    "text": "Selling Is Critical to Survival Whether you're rich or poor, male or female, on salary or on commission, you're always selling something to someone in order to advance. There is NO exception to this rule and no way to escape it. The receptionist who wants a raise, the actress who wants a part, the guy who wants a girl-all rely on selling themselves, whether they know it or not. A professional salesperson who depends on sales for his or her livelihood definitely needs to know how to sell. But these other people need to sell as well. When you're driving to work and want to get off the freeway, you have to negotiate and sell to other drivers your intention to access the off- ramp. When you go to the bank to get a loan, you'll need to sell the loan officers on why they should lend you money. When the actress goes to the audition and hopes to land the part, she'd better be able to convince the director that not only can she act, but she is the right person for the part! Even beyond your role as a professional salesperson, the better you master the skill of sales, the more you'll get what you want in ALL areas of life. A person's ability to persuade another is the ONLY thing that will ultimately ensure a position in the marketplace. Academic records, grades, and resumes won't guarantee you a promotion or advancement in life, but the ability to sell will. Smart sales managers and business owners don't always hire the most intelligent or qualified person to fill a position. Instead, they look for the person who convinces them that he or she can do the job. The best companies hire the persuasive, positive, and confident applicant hands down over the one who offers little more than a fancy resume. 3."

    "text": "Sales Success Is Business Success You may have figured it out already, but salespeople are a company's lifeblood. Without a successful sales team, no company will last long. Sears is a great example of a strong brand that absolutely tanked because that company didn't pay attention to its sales. People loved Sears. You'd go in there and they had the hardware and tools section, and the people who worked there were absolute masters. They could talk for an hour about why this Craftsman lawn mower was better than that one. People would come in just to see what was new, not because they were in the market for a snowblower but because it was a social thing. It was like the old general store where people stood around shooting the breeze... but that's only what it looked like. These guys were SELLING. Because maybe you didn't need a snowblower today, but when you DID need one, you went to Sears. But then the chairman and board lost sight of that. They tried to turn Sears into an Amazon with doors, the place people go for low prices, not for conversation and connection. And that was the end of Sears. Why go to Sears and pay more when you could order the same thing from Amazon and get it cheaper? Sears got rid of that comfortable feel, cut their staffing, and suddenly the customers were gone too. They lost sight of the role of the salesperson. Borders Books-remember them? They did the same thing. Borders used to be this amazing bookstore where people who loved books would go to hang out because they loved to be around books. And they hired salespeople who loved books, too, so if you needed a good book for your 10-year-old nephew or you wanted a great beach read that was like James Patterson, you could ask them and they'd recommend THREE books and you'd end up buying all three. If you just wanted a specific book, you'd go to Amazon, right? But if you wanted to talk about books with other people who love books, you'd go to Borders. Maybe you'd pay more, but you'd get the whole experience. But then they started cutting corners too. They cut staff. They hired people who didn't know the first thing about books. And suddenly they were-surprise!-going out of business. This happens in all sorts of businesses. I see it a lot in the tech space. The engineers and developers think their product is so great that it can sell itself. But that's a myth. There are thousands of companies out there with great products that no one has ever heard of. The salesperson is the front line of the business, the intermediary between the customer or client and the rest of the company. Great salespeople can drive a business's success, but it's a rare business that can survive without a talented sales team. That's why successful salespeople can often write their ticket in terms of compensation and career. There are so many people out there who do not understand, who do not believe, that sales are at the root of their success and their survival. Again, no matter what field you are in, no matter what your title is, you have to know how to sell. Believing that the skill of sales matters is the first step to becoming a great salesperson. You need to believe sales matter. You need to believe your product or service matters. And you need to believe YOU matter. PART 2: SALESPEOPLE MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND If someone asked you to define sales, what would your answer be? Probably something along the lines of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary's definition: \u201cThe action of persuading or influencing another to a course of action or to the acceptance of something.\u201d That's a pretty good working definition, but anyone who's spent any time in the field will know that sales goes much deeper than that. And by unpacking what sales is at its core, we can start to understand what makes a successful salesperson. 1."

    "text": "Salespeople Drive Entire Economies We talked in the previous section about how sales success is business success. But it goes even farther than that: Sales success is ECONOMY success. Career salespeople are vital to the dynamics of any economy. Without salespeople, every industry on the planet would stop cold tomorrow. Salespeople are to the economy what writers are to Hollywood; things don't move forward without them! The world would stop turning without salespeople. If a product isn't sold and moved on to the public, factories stop, production stops, there's no need for distribution, no need for storage, demand for shipping is reduced, and advertising stops. The burden of the entire economy of our culture today rests on the ability of salespeople. The economic engine of society relies completely on the ability to get products into the hands of consumers. If the consumers don't buy it, the factories won't make it. Salespeople drive products, individual businesses, complete industries, and whole economies. Selling is the last great truly free-enterprise opportunity available today. In sales, you can work for yourself, be accountable to yourself, and make your dreams come true. For those who are willing to commit to selling as a career, and to continue to learn how to master it, there are no limits. All you need is a pen to sign contracts and a commitment to excel, and your future is unlimited. 2."

    "subsection_topic": "All Professions Rely on Sales",
    "text": "All Professions Rely on Sales I know without a doubt that for a person to have a great life, he or she will have to know and apply the skills of any great salesperson. You can hire a doctor, a lawyer, or an architect. You can get by without knowing how to set a broken ankle, prepare a contract, or design a house. But you cannot get along in life without the ability to communicate, persuade, negotiate, and close a deal. These skills give you the ability to write the ticket for your future. Rather than being an hourly worker bee, you can become a highly paid individual with no ceiling on your earning potential-but you have to know how to sell. Spend time with a leader in any profession-engineers, bankers, actors, film directors, you name it. Every one of those people had to build a career around selling to get to the top of their industry. Of those top producers, virtually every single one studies books on negotiating, selling, and persuading. Why? Because they understand that those skills are vital to their success. As we discussed earlier, every person, no matter what profession they're in, relies on selling. Politicians want to appeal to you and your interests so that you'll vote for them in the polling booth. Public speakers are hoping to convince you that their approach is the right one. Employees desiring a promotion will have to sell the boss on their value to the company. The coach has to sell his or her team on the idea of winning the game. Real estate agents must convince you to buy a house or give them the listing. The mortgage lender wants you to refinance for the third time. The banker wants you to invest money in the bank's mutual funds. The waiter is selling the special of the day. The clothing salesperson wants you to buy the suit along with three shirts and two ties... and also wants you to apply for the department store's credit card. Selling never, ever ends, and it includes everyone. Those who can sell, persuade, and close are the ones who survive best, regardless of the line of work. No person will ever gain true power and stature in the world without the ability to persuade others. The ability to communicate and convince others is an asset for you; the inability to communicate is a liability. No matter what your ambitions are, you are required to communicate with others, and the better you can communicate, the more people will agree with you. The more you can get others to agree with you, the more you can have your way in life. The more you get your way in life, the more you will enjoy life. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "Beware of False Data",
    "text": "Beware of False Data You might be wondering why we're spending so much time on this issue of the importance of sales in the economy, in your company, and in your life. It's because so many people have fallen into the world of sales by accident rather than by choice. And as a result, they don't fully believe in the possibilities of sales, or in the importance of the profession. This is where I want to warn you about the power of false data. The subject of selling, like any subject, is full of false information that has been perpetuated over the years. These false data may be partly responsible for the poor impression of this profession and much-needed life skill. \u201cFalse Data\u201d is information that is not factual but is accepted as truth and passed along. People tend to form opinions, give advice, and pass on myths when they don't actually have any personal experience. Much of the data they pass along hasn't been fully inspected for truth even though it's been passed along as truth. This occurs with sales, and it has given the whole profession and the skill itself a bad name. People continue to pass on the false information that selling is hard, that it's difficult to depend on commissions, that selling is sleazy, that you'll have to work long hours, that it isn't a dependable profession, that you can't rely on the income, and that it's not considered a \u201creal job.\u201d It's a shame, because selling, as we've said, is the one profession where you can write your check and determine your future. Most of the perceptions people have-and maybe even some that you have-are rarely based on reality. If you believe the wrong things about this profession, you're going to undermine your own belief in the importance of your role. And when you don't believe what you do all day matters, how good are you going to be at it? Let's say you're a dental hygienist, one of those dedicated heroes who spends all day in other people's mouths, scraping away the plaque and trying to convince people to floss. But if you don't really believe that brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing really matters, how good are you going to be at convincing others of it? Lousy, right? Let's say you're a high school math teacher. Let's make it even better- you're a geometry teacher. But you honestly think geometry is a complete waste of time. Are you going to be able to teach your students with confidence and conviction that they need to know this stuff to make their lives better? Teenagers have built-in lie detectors, and they'll smell you out a mile away. No way can you convince them of something you're not convinced of yourself. The same will be true with your clients and customers. You must believe in your product, your company, and yourself to make the sale. In upcoming sections, we'll dive deeper into the importance of belief and commitment, and how without them, it will be impossible to achieve your goals. PART 3: PROFESSIONAL OR AMATEUR? As I mentioned previously, selling doesn't need to be your primary career in order to become a great salesperson. In fact, I know some businesspeople whose job function is not \u201csales,\u201d yet they're better salespeople than those who are hired to sell. Just because your business card says \u201csales rep\u201d or \u201csales manager\u201d, it doesn't make you a professional. In the sports world, a professional is, for the most part, someone who gets paid to perform, while an amateur doesn't. That distinction is somewhat blurry, but it still holds weight. And it carries over to the sales world as well; professional salespeople make more money than amateurs. But that's not where the differences end. 1."

    "text": "The Professional A professional is a person who is engaged in a specified activity as his or her main paid occupation rather than as a pastime. It's been my experience that 99% of all \u201cprofessional\u201d salespeople have only a slight idea of what selling is, much less how to actually determine and predict results. Have you ever seen someone who produced four or five times more than the average person? The way they think is different. The way they act is different. They work different, they have different habits, even their customers are different. Their responses are different, and therefore, the results are different too. It's easy to sit back and say, \u201cWell, they're just a natural salesperson,\u201d or \u201cThey're just lucky. They get all the good leads.\u201d But believe me when I say that people who are great aren't born great. They have paid immense fees of energy and effort, and have invested hours, upon hours, upon hours, (to achieve that success). When you're born, you're not born a salesperson. You're born a baby. Great salespeople believe in the power of sales to help them reach their goals. They have made a decision to motivate themselves, to learn everything they can, and they are committed to their craft. And this process never ends. Professionals also believe in themselves. They know that sales gives them unlimited opportunity, and they own the fact that it's their own efforts that will determine how high they fly. They don't blame fate. They don't blame God. They don't blame their company, or their sales manager, or the weather, or the economy. They take 100% responsibility. 2."

    "text": "The Amateur An amateur is a person who engages in a pursuit, study, science, or sport as a pastime rather than a profession, or one lacking in experience or competence in an art or science. Most salespeople are actually amateurs who don't know the first thing about selling. Maybe you've encountered some of these people, either when you went to buy a new phone, a new car, or a new house. Or maybe you know you-yourself-are less than a professional. Is selling just a pastime to you, no different than watching television? Do you lack experience and competence in this field? Are you not clear about what you're doing while negotiating? Do you struggle to get your way in life? Do you have a secret disdain for this thing called selling? Do you hate rejection and even the idea of selling another? Do you think great salespeople are just born that way? Quit thinking it's up to fate, or the Universe, or God. God's got his hands full! Don't count on Him to get you a deal today and help you meet quota. It's up to you-your very life and dreams depend on it. If you're not getting what you want, quit making excuses and decide now to learn everything there is to learn about becoming a professional. That's what takes you out of amateur status-a desire to be great, not average. A desire to be incredible, and the dedication and willingness to learn the skills you need. Great salespeople know their income depends only on one thing: Their ability to generate customers, to make themselves known in the marketplace, to get agreements from people, to close sales, and then to reproduce those results over and over again. If you can do that, I assure you, your future is only limited by what your imagination will allow you. And speaking of your imagination... professionals know they have to get their minds right. They know that it all starts in the brain. You can't outperform your internal limits, which is why Grant and our courses here at Cardone University spend so much time on mindset. What we want to do is to convince you to be great. Give up the mediocre, the poor results, the excuses. I want to help you dig in and be great. To do that, you have to convince yourself that this is your field, your chosen profession; that selling is the skill that you have to learn to get what you want in life, and that this thing called selling can make you rich. If you are willing to do that, then welcome aboard. Let's buckle down and get to work. 3."

    "text": "The Great Shortage For thousands of years, wealth has been amassed and riches have been accumulated by salespeople. Those same opportunities still exist today. This segment's about getting you to realize the world isn't coming to an end. Forget about Artificial Intelligence. Forget about companies going direct to consumer. There are still opportunities for great salespeople- and there always will be. Unfortunately, a lot of people-and maybe even you-believed the media when it talked about how there would only be somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 million sales jobs in 2020. Fake news, right? People still overwhelmingly want to buy from people, not from machines. Take Carvana, the giant car vending machine. It's marketed as the first automated, coin-operated car vending machine in the U.S. It's cool. It's eye- catching. It's a gimmick. Because are you really going to drop $15-20K on a car without talking to a real, live person first? In fact, here's how it really works. You don't drive up to the thing and put in $15K in quarters and get whatever car is available. Instead, the cars that are prestocked in the machines have ALREADY been selected and purchased. It's not really an automated vending machine; it's an automated DELIVERY machine. You can go through the car search and purchase process online, but there's a big phone number on each page in case you have questions. Because many, many people want to talk to someone before they make a purchase that big. So don't believe people who say the sales profession is dying. I assure you there is a vast shortage of highly committed, highly dedicated, great salespeople. And when there's a shortage -and you can fill in that shortage- you become valuable. This is good news for those who choose to be great at their job. The world is like a treasure chest of opportunity, just waiting for great salespeople to open it. The key in being eternally employable lies in creating value. If you can always create more value for your employer than the amount they pay you, you'll always have a job. The truth is you can get paid whatever you want. There is no ceiling, but you have to learn the trade. Remember, there's a great shortage, right? So if you filled in the void, and separated yourself from the masses, the mediocre, then you can choose what products you want to sell, who you want to sell them to, who you want to work with, what part of the country you want to work in, what your pay plan is going to be, and when you come and go. That's where we want to get you. Truly great salespeople stand head and shoulders above the rest, above the mediocre. They're not even in the same profession as most salespeople. They think different, and that's what we're going to get into in the next sections. PART 4: THE GREATS Now that we've explored the basics of sales-why sales matter, what sales are, and the differences between a professional and an amateur-it's time to dive into the specifics that will help you become a better salesperson. Even better, how do you become one of the greats in your field? The first step is to commit ALL THE WAY. We've talked previously about sales being a commitment. I want to dive into the concept of commitment more deeply. In fact, we've dedicated a substantial part of this training to the topic of commitment because it's so extremely important. 1."

    "subsection_topic": "Commitment",
    "text": "Commitment We said in the last section that success all starts in your mind, and that's where we're starting this section... with the one critical decision that will set you apart: Commitment. This inescapable truth, commitment, is required for ANYONE to be truly great at ANYTHING. So let's look at what commitment is: Commit: To devote oneself completely to something. The inescapable truth is that to be truly great at anything, you must devote yourself completely. If you are a career salesperson, you have to devote yourself, your energy, and your resources to a career in selling. So how does a person commit? What I do is eliminate any and all other options and devote myself to learning everything I can about the topic. Grant calls this becoming a Super Freak. And if you've ever seen him in action, you know what that means. You've got to stop questioning and go all in. You've got to stop looking for other options. If you've ever made a real commitment before, you know it's actually a freeing action rather than a restrictive one. Here's what I mean. Every single day there are unlimited calls on your time and resources. In this day and age, we can pretty much do, or be, or have anything we're willing to really work for. Want a private jet? Work very hard and buy one. Want to own the Mavericks? There's no law against it. A little kid today can grow up to be an astronaut, the president, a janitor, or work the counter at 7-Eleven. In other times and in other cultures right now, this wasn't the case. People were destined to a particular track in life because it was what their parents did, or because of the social class they were born into, or because of their color, or gender, or whatever. We have untold freedom of opportunity and mobility. We can be what we want, go where we want, hang out with who we want, and spend our money on what we want. But all this choice comes at a cost. Research shows that the more choices someone has, the less satisfied they are with the choice they do make. It's like we're constantly looking at what we could have done and wondering if we would have been happier in Toledo or Toronto, or thinking, \"Perhaps, I should have gone to law school.\" The solution to this constant second-guessing is to make a commitment. You lay it down. You say, this is what I'm doing, and that's it. It begins with a decision, and then once you make that decision, you're free from the other options. They're no longer on the table. You're in. That's freedom-freedom from doubt, freedom from wasting your time thinking about what could have been. If you're average right now, mediocre, if you don't like the results you're getting, understand you made a decision to do that. It's not mommy's fault or daddy's fault or your manager's fault, it's not the way you were brought up. It's because you haven't made a commitment-a decision-to be more. Committing means making a decision-a firm and final decision. Think about commitments people make in life. The one that typically comes to mind is marriage, because it's one of the biggest commitments many of us will ever make. But what's the divorce rate in this country? Something like 50%? What kind of commitment is that, really, if half the people are headed for splitsville? The problem is that their commitment wasn't 100%. In the back of their mind, there was an out, an option that if things don't work out, they can always get a divorce. Now, I'm not trying to point the finger at anyone here who's been divorced. It's nothing anyone ever wants to have happened. I don't know your particular situation, and you may have been married to the guy or gal from hell... I get that. What I'm trying to point out is that the definition of commitment is to devote yourself completely to something. Remember that. Write it out and put it on your desk: \u201cTo devote oneself completely to something.\u201d You've got to devote yourself all the way. Since we're talking about selling, then that means you've got to devote yourself to what? You have to devote yourself, your energy, your resources to a career in selling. That means you need to think, eat, breathe, read everything, and consume everything you can on this thing called selling. You have to convince yourself that this is your field, your chosen profession. This is what you're dedicating your energy and your time to. This is how you get to where you want to go. You dig in all the way. What you have to do when you commit is eliminate all other options, and then you can devote yourself completely to this one avenue. That's the only way. You may think it sounds like being a fanatic, well, fine, be a fanatic. You're going to exhaust that one avenue, not go looking for three or four other ways. Think about parking your car. When you park a car, do you get confused? Do you say, \u201cOh there's a parking spot, there's one, there's another, what about that one? Which one do I choose?\u201d No, you pull in, you park, you get out. You don't keep thinking, \u201cwell, maybe I should have chosen the one in the second row...\u201d But some of you do this in your relationships or in your jobs. Then you wonder why things don't work out. It's because you keep looking for something better or something different. That doesn't work. Instead, you choose, you go all in, and you follow through. 2."

You've heard that saying about \u201cThe grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.\u201d That's human nature, to look at what other people have and are doing and think they've somehow got it better than you. You know where the grass is greener? The grass is greener where people are mowing and watering it. Wherever you go, you have to mow the lawn. Weeds are everywhere. Take care of your own lawn. That's your career we're talking about! If you're looking at someone else's pasture-at another job-what the heck are you doing? Commit all the way. Fortify yourself. If you're going to be wrong, be wrong all the way. If there are weeds in your grass, they grow because you're not committed to taking care of them. You're neglecting your career. You're neglecting your clients. You're neglecting your chosen path. You're neglecting what you're doing RIGHT NOW in this moment by never fully committing to it. Some of you are doing that right now-you're thinking about something else. You're checking your phone. You're answering emails, or doing a crossword puzzle, or whatever. What are you doing? How you treat this training, right now, is how you're treating your business and your career and probably your family and your health too. And when you neglect anything, you'll start to dislike it. You'll start looking for something better. A better house, a better job, a better car, a better spouse... Has this ever happened to you? You think, we need to move, this house is too old, or too small, or I don't like the kitchen, or whatever. So you meet with a real estate agent and they tell you all the things you need to fix so you can get the best price for your house. You declutter everything, you replace the rugs in the bathroom, maybe you paint and rearrange some stuff and plant flowers out front, and pretty soon you're like, \u201cHey, this place looks pretty good. I'm not sure I want to move.\u201d What happened? You started to pay attention. You looked at all the places you'd been neglecting at your home, like the garage door opener that didn't work, the dead flowers on the side yard, and the paint scratches where the kids ran their bikes into the wall. All those things you'd been neglecting. And once you fixed them, you fell back in love with the place. This neglect can happen to your house, to your marriage, to your job, and all it takes to correct it is to start tending your own grass again. Watch how green your pastures get. 3. The Only Reason You Won't"

    "text": "Like Selling There's only one true reason why someone doesn't like selling. Do you know what it is? It's not what you might think. It's not because someone doesn't like rejection. After all, who does? It's not because they're lazy. People who are avoiding failure or being rejected are going to be lazy. It's not because they don't like people. We all like people when we're successful with them. The only reason someone doesn't like what they do is because they don't KNOW what they are doing. You won't win at something you don't understand. The doctor who can't save lives won't like being a doctor. The teacher who can't get his or her students to learn will, sooner or later, become disenchanted with teaching. A salesperson who can't close deals won't like selling. And that's the only reason you would not like being a salesperson. When you don't understand something, you aren't in control, and when you aren't in control, you won't like what you're doing! The more you know, the better you'll do. And the better you do, the more you'll like your job. I've never seen someone who reached stellar levels of success in any field who got there because of luck or some sort of God-given talent. They're successful because they mastered their trade. The same is true for sales. Great salespeople have made a commitment to become great. Only a handful of people around you, in your team, in your industry, will make a commitment to becoming the best they can be. I'm not talking about passively watching a few training videos; instead, I'm talking about rolling up your sleeves and immersing yourself in the world of sales. Reading books. Taking courses. Doing the work. If you want to be great at sales, you need to consume as much as you can. You need to be dedicated and committed to your future, to the solvency of your household, to the financial security of your spouse and your kids. While motivation is great and necessary, and enthusiasm can be a great enhancement, there's no replacement for knowing your job. Tiger Woods did not become great by being enthusiastic about golf. Instead, he KNOWS the game of golf. He knows what he's doing, every nuance, every little crevice and crack, consideration and possibility, and technique. And as a result, he doesn't have to be enthusiastic. His commitment to mastering his craft is what has carried him to his level of success. To become one of the greats, you have to practice, not just play. PART 5: THE MOST IMPORTANT SALE In this segment we're going to talk about the most important sale you can ever make. It ties right into commitment. It's all about selling yourself. 1."

    "text": "Selling Yourself If you don't believe, no one else will. Here's what I mean: To the degree that you're sold, convinced, persuaded, you will sell. This is a vital and critically unavoidable fact that cannot be missed if you want to become great at your trade. This fact also happens to be one of the most important tools you'll ever have as a salesperson, and can be used to actually monitor the results of your career. The bottom line is, if you're not selling, to some degree you're not sold. I want to say that again. If you're not selling, if you saw your production drop, immediately understand, \u201cHey, I'm not sold on something.\u201d If your sales are slowing down, there's something happening. \u201cIt's not traffic. It's not your competitors. It's not the economy. No. You got sold on something else and are now unsold on what it takes to get results. If you're not getting your way, if you're not achieving your goals, you're not sold. If you've got any excuses about it, I promise you you're just not completely sold. In order to become great, I mean GREAT, a master at selling, you have to sell yourself on what it is you're selling. Make this the single most important sale of your life and keep making that sale. It's not something you do one time. You've got to keep reinforcing what product you're selling, the company you're selling, you. I know salespeople who know the game but who are not completely and absolutely sold on their product, service, or company. Because of their lack of conviction, they are not consistent producers. You've got to convince yourself that your product, your company, your services, your ideas are superior to all others. You have to be 100% certain that what you're selling is better than all other options. The fraud-the guy or girl who doesn't believe his or her product is superior- can't get consistent results because he or she is not completely sold on that product. You have to be utterly convinced and believe in what you're selling so strongly that you become unreasonable about it-even fanatical! You have to be so convinced that you won't even consider that anyone else could even compete with you. When you believe at this level, you can get more money for similar products than your competitors, because you believe so strongly in your service, your level of care, and the superiority of your products. You may even sell products that are priced higher than your competition because you believe so strongly in the value. You're so convinced of the product's worth that you would pay the higher price to have it! 2."

    "text": "Conviction Is the Make/Break Point Have you ever sold something-your home, a car, yourself to an employer- for a price higher than what the market was paying at the time? Maybe you believed your house was worth more than what the real estate agent said because of its unique view or location. Or maybe you negotiated for a higher salary than others in your position, because you were so convinced of the value you could bring to the company. Once you become convinced of the value, you can convince others too. But if you don't believe first, they never will! The conviction you have regarding your product is more important than the conviction that others have about their facts and figures! Are you familiar with the definition of the word \u201cconviction?\u201d It is defined as \u201ca firmly held belief.\u201d It comes from the word \u201cconvince,\u201d which is derived from the Latin word \u201cconvict,\u201d which means, \u201cto conquer.\u201d Conviction is the ability to be so solid and firmly sold on your beliefs, that you demonstrate to your buyers with such complete and utter certainty that they see no other choice but yours. A sale is made when your conviction and belief about something are stronger than somebody else's, at which point the other person gives up some of his or her conviction. That's the moment when the sale becomes possible-that's the make/break point. The real issue isn't the product or service at this point; the issue is who is more sold- or convinced-on what he or she believes to be true. Who is the most believable and convincing? It will always be the one who is the most sold on his or her product or service! A highly trained U.S. Army Ranger is so deeply sold on his mission and so sold on the cause and purpose that he's able to do things that appear superhuman to others. He's 100% convinced of the need to perform at this level-and so he does. Why? Because he's sold on the mission! He doesn't have to think about it. He's already decided. He believes in it to his very core, and because of this, he's able to do the impossible. People will always tell you your dreams and goals are impossible. Alexander Graham Bell. Elon Musk. Steve Jobs. Gymnast Gabby Douglas. All these people were told their dreams were totally impossible. But here's the interesting thing about the impossible. It's only impossible until someone makes it possible! Look at photography, flight, space travel, email, the internet, a sub-4-minute mile, and on and on. All of these things were once considered impossible-until someone became sold on them being possible. Why is it that some people do things that others wouldn't dream of doing? Because they're convinced. They're sold on the idea that it needs to be done, and it CAN be done. To the degree that they are sold and become unreasonable in their quest, they will succeed. Stop thinking about being reasonable and sensible. The world was never changed by people who were reasonable! These characteristics will not serve you in sales, or in life. If you want something great to happen, you've got to be unreasonable. You have to be completely and unreasonably sold on yourself, your product, and your ideas. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is",
    "text": "Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is Here's a simple way to test if you are sold yourself. You may say you have 100% commitment and belief. That's great. Here's a simple, objective way to tell: Do you use your own product? If you wouldn't buy the product or if you have any negative considerations about how it benefits others, you cannot succeed beyond your degree of doubt. You MUST be sold. You must get rid of all negative considerations and believe that it's the right product for the person you're selling, and that it will benefit them. You might ask yourself, \u201cBut what if I'm not convinced that I have the best product or the best service?\u201d Then get convinced, and do it right now! Do whatever it takes to believe that you're offering the greatest product and the greatest service. Find the plus points and sell yourself on them completely. Should you lie to yourself? Of course not, but you've got to get yourself sold no matter what! Rather than lying to yourself, a better alternative is to do what a champion does: Champions decide to win the game with what they have to work with. They don't change teams. They make the most of the assets and strengths available to them. They play the cards they've been dealt and they make the most of the pot. They don't lie to themselves; they convince themselves that the only solution is winning, and they commit to one outcome only-success! One time, a buddy of mine was trying to convince me to go in on a big deal. He said the investment was a sure thing, and a great opportunity. But something just wasn't ringing true to me. I wasn't convinced because HE didn't sound convinced. It wasn't the deal that was the hold up as much as it was HIM. Something was just off. So finally I asked, \u201cHow much of your money have you invested?\u201d You can guess what the answer was: ZERO! Of course, maybe he didn't have enough money... but if the deal was THAT good and THAT much of a sure thing, wouldn't he have done whatever he could to get in on it? As you can imagine, I passed on this \u201cgolden opportunity.\u201d What are you going to tell your prospects when they ask you if you drive the car you're selling, live in one of the houses you're selling, own stock in the fund you want them to invest in? You better be able to tell them YES! By owning the product you're selling, you're demonstrating your certainty to others by your actions, and actions speak way louder than words. You have to be so sold that you use your own product, consume your product, and sell your product to your loved ones. Otherwise, you're just a mercenary, selling for whoever pays you the most. A finance and insurance salesman came to us for help because he was having trouble selling his products. When we asked him which finance and insurance products he owned himself, he chuckled and said, \u201cNone!\u201d He went on to explain that he didn't want to spend the extra money on them. Well, that's not totally accurate. The truth is he didn't spend the money because he didn't think it was worth it. If you were completely sold on the value of something, you wouldn't concern yourself with the money. You'd buy it! No wonder he was having trouble making his numbers. He wasn't convinced, so how was he going to convince someone else? If you're having a similar problem, the answer is simple. All you have to do is buy and use the products you sell and then watch your sales go up. To the degree that you're sold, you'll take action. And to the degree that you take action, you'll be successful at selling to others. Become so thoroughly sold on your product that your conviction is irresistible to others, that you believe it would be a terrible thing for the buyer to do business anywhere else with any other product. Of course, I don't mean you should lie to yourself. What I'm suggesting is that you take the time to sell yourself before you try to sell someone else on how your product is superior to others. Go into an Apple store and ask anyone who works there how much they like their products. It's always a love fest. They'll go on and on about their Apple Watch, their Apple TV, their Macbook, their iPhone... it's like a religious movement, they believe so deeply in their products. You need to be at that level of commitment, conviction, and belief. If you won't buy it yourself, then you're not sold yourself! It's that simple. PART 6: MASSIVE ACTION Most people incorrectly estimate the amount of effort it takes to get the results they want. They think about being balanced, or what is reasonable. That is a losing mentality. Instead, you need to think in terms of MASSIVE ACTION. Whatever you think is needed to get the job done, increase the amount far greater than you think is necessary, and you'll get results beyond your wildest expectations. In this section, we're going to dive into what it means to take massive action. If you want to make your dreams come true, if you want to become great at what you're doing, it's going to take work. But when it comes to getting big results and becoming wildly successful, you have to take action in that direction in massive quantities. There's no way around it. 1."

    "subsection_topic": "The Four Kinds of Action",
    "text": "The Four Kinds of Action You can never take enough action in life; you can only take too little. Too much action will never get you into trouble. In fact, taking action is the way to get out of trouble. The only time action will cause you trouble is when there isn't any or when there's not enough of it. If you've ever been in trouble, you ask yourself, \u201cWhat do I need to do right now?\u201d If you're trying to solve a problem, you ask yourself, \u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d That's action. It's been said there are three kinds of action in life: 1. The right action. I did the right thing and I got the result. You studied an average amount for the test, and you got an average grade. 2. The wrong action. I did the wrong action and I didn't like the outcome. You studied a little bit, or you studied the wrong thing, and you got a mediocre grade on the exam. 3. No action. I did nothing, and I got nothing. You didn't study at all, and you failed the exam. Now, we believe in a fourth action: 4. MASSIVE action. That's the one you want to live by! This fourth action is by far the action that will prove that you get results. It will make you successful. No matter what your skill set, it will allow you to produce at a higher rate than others. If you ask super- successful people what one thing has made the most difference in their life, it's going to be taking massive action, even when they had no clue what they were doing! For instance, if you want to buy an investment property, you don't go to one lender for a loan; you go to three or four, or even five or six. If you want coverage in the newspaper, you don't call one, you call ten, and you call them again and again. Let's say you're giving a party and you want 250 people to show up. How many people do you invite? It's gotta be more than 250, right? And you can't trust the RSVP, especially these days. So how do you prevent an empty house and a lame party? First, you invite way more people than 250... like 750. Then you call them and remind them. It's better to have too many people than too few! I bet you can see how this carries over to sales. You need to apply massive action. Way too often, people are working the phone and they make a few phone calls, send out a few emails, and then take a coffee break. Then they sit down and talk to each other about how business is slow and how the phone and prospecting don't get them results. If you work the phone properly, you'd know that it's not the phone that works; it's the person ON the phone who's working. Don't sit down to make one phone call. When you sit down to use the phone, do it with enough tenacity and with such massive quantity that you KNOW you're going to get something in return- guaranteed. Don't sit down to make one phone call. Sit down to make 40 phone calls. It's not how smart you are or even how trained you are that makes the biggest difference; it's the action you take. Never put your trust in one situation. Take massive action, work on multiple fronts, and then you'll always end up with a solution. Take massive action all the way to the end. 2. Massive Action = New Problems How do you know if you're taking enough action? Here's one way to tell: Your problems have changed. For instance, let's say you want to fill your calendar. That's your problem right now, not enough appointments. You need to take massive action until your concern is no longer whether or not you'll get enough appointments, but how you can possibly handle all of the appointments you have. That's a new problem! Your concern is no longer whether or not you'll get appointments; your concern has to shift into a new problem in order for you to have taken enough action. You have to take so much action that it results in a new problem. You get on the phone, because you need an appointment. You get one appointment for today at 2 pm-and the appointment doesn't show. Is that an old problem or a new problem? Old, right? You've had it before. So that means you have to take more action. So here's what you do: You make enough phone calls until you have two or three people coming in at 3 pm. That's a new problem- three people showing up at the same time. That's the kind of problem you want! Think about a seminar. The old problem is that you want to have enough of a crowd there. The NEW problem would be you have so many people show up, there aren't enough seats. That tells you that you've taken enough action! Doing too much will never fail you, but doing too little ALWAYS will. When you're a younger or newer salesperson, you might not be perfect or polished- and that's okay. IF you're willing to take massive amounts of action. When you get the volume going, you don't have to be perfect. In fact, you'll never become polished if you only have a handful of opportunities. You've got to practice to improve. The more action you take, the more business you'll have, and the better you'll get at your job. Most people don't get enough in life because they never do enough. It's not bad luck. It's not the market. You're just not taking enough action. Production is what results in happiness. It makes you feel good. And the way to produce is to take massive action. People who produce feel good. Massive action is the single thing that will guarantee you increase success, more so than any other single thing you can do. If you want to guarantee that you achieve X, take massive amounts of action that will achieve it in abundance. Your problem will no longer be how to achieve an abundance of X. Instead it will be how to manage the abundance of X. By taking enough massive action, something will be changed, something will be created, and results will be attained. And when those around you tell you you're working too hard and you need to slow down, that's a sign that you are on the right track. Ignore them and keep producing! Don't quit until you get new problems-problems like taxes, cars, homes, and where to go on vacation. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "The 10X Rule",
    "text": "The 10X Rule Hey let's suppose you want something-an account, a certain income level, to lose 10 pounds. How much action do you have to take? What is considered \u201cmassive action?\u201d Here's our rule of thumb: Figure out how much effort you think you'd need to take, or that the average person would take, to achieve that goal. Then take massive action equal to at least TEN TIMES what you think it will take. This is the 10X rule. If you take 10 times more action than you thought was necessary, would you be certain, guaranteed to get that one thing to achieve your goal? This is how you want to start operating. Look, if you do 10X of what you think it's going to take, you can give up hope. You won't have to hope! You won't have to wish, cross your fingers like a little seven year old. You won't have to depend on others anymore and you won't have to pray for what you want. What you want-and far more-will come to you when the right amount of action-10X Action-is created. Think about the salesperson who goes on and on about the bad luck he's having. Maybe you know someone like this. Or maybe YOU'VE been this person. His appointment canceled. A buyer backed out. Another customer had to change his order. Another buyer couldn't get financing. On and on and on. You know what the problem here is, right? It's not bad luck. It's not misfortune. It's not the economy. It's that the salesperson doesn't have enough in his pipeline. If he took ten times more action than he had been doing, he would have no time to even think about these so-called misfortunes and would have actually WELCOMED someone canceling, as it would have been a relief to get a break instead of a misfortune. If you take enough action and are getting results, then it's not a big deal when an appointment cancels or a buyer backs out. Your massive action, your 10X action, is a safety net. You won't freak out when one appointment cancels or one buyer backs out or when you can't get funding or you don't get the listing because you've got backups. If you take small amounts of action, what's going to happen? You get small results. Then every time you lose that one appointment or that one deal, you're going to start stressing out and moaning about misfortune, bad luck, etc. because you're so dependent upon that one deal. You don't have anything to replace that one deal with. Why? Because you didn't take enough action. You put too much attention on too little. Your attention needs to be on massive amounts of action knowing that if you take enough action you're going to get results. Grant in particular is known for this. It's like his calling card. I once saw Grant call a client over the course of three days; he called this client 15 times without getting an answer. He texted him, called him, emailed him, sent him video clips, you name it. I was starting to get a little anxious. I said, \u201cGrant, do you think that's too much? Are you overdoing it?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I don't think that's too much, in fact, if anything, it's not enough because I haven't gotten a result yet.\u201d The lesson here: Never be reasonable when it comes to taking action. If you want to get something done, keep taking action-extraordinary, unreasonable levels of action. Massive action. 10X action. Think about what a reasonable person with their mediocre results would get, and then 10X it. Let's say a realtor wants a listing. Should he or she call 100 people or one or two? If you want appointments, call every friend you have, call every past client, stop people on the street, do whatever it takes. Be without sanity, or logic, or reason when it comes to taking massive amounts of action and you'll reach heights that others never dreamed possible. Massive action equals new problems, this will equal massive sales and massive results. PART 7: PUTTING IT TOGETHER: YOUR 90-DAY MASSIVE ACTION PLAN So here's where we are so far: We've talked about how selling is a prerequisite for life, and not only does sales success = business success, your ability to sell actually determines your ability to survive and thrive in today's world. We distinguished between a professional salesperson and an amateur, and we talked about how the best salespeople will never be out of a job, because there is always a shortage of people who have mastered the skills involved in sales. We discussed what it takes to be great in your field, and how the key to your future is the commitment to your path. Then we dove into the most important sale of all: Selling yourself, over and over again. Finally, we introduced you to the topic of MASSIVE ACTION, and Grant's 10X Rule not only for sales, but for life! You learned how the key to your success is taking 10 times what might be considered \u201creasonable\u201d action. Why? Because we're not after \u201creasonable\u201d results, we're after greatness! Now, in this final section, we'll pull it all together. We'll take these previous sections and put them into a massive action plan for your next 90 days so you can take the next step on your personal path to greatness as a professional salesperson. Ready? Your Massive Action Plan for the next 90 days can be broken into three parts:"

    "text": "The 10X Plan, or what you think you're going to do, and finally the 10X Execution, which is when the rubber meets the road and you actually go DO the things you've been talking and thinking about. Let's start at the foundation, with your 10X mindset. 1. The 10X Mindset We've talked previously about the importance of getting your mind right. If you don't believe in yourself, in your product, and in your company, then you're not going to be successful, period. Think about any successful professional athlete who's interviewed before the big game. Tom Brady before the Super Bowl. Steph Curry before the NBA finals. Tiger Woods before the Masters. Carli Lloyd before the World Cup. When they're interviewed, what do they express? Absolute commitment. Absolute certainty. Absolute confidence. They're all in. Just imagine seeing one of these athletes interviewed on ESPN and the announcer saying, \u201cSo, how are you feeling today? Do you think you can win?\u201d And they answer, \u201cWell, I'm not sure. I don't feel great about our chances. We've had a tough season and we're just not up for it.\u201d Give an interview like that, and the odds in Vegas are going to go wild! People want to hear certainty. Commitment. Confidence. Anything less than that is a big question mark. So you're not a professional athlete. Okay. What about the pilot on the last flight you took. The pilot comes on the intercom at the beginning of the flight and says, \u201cWell, folks, it's pretty rough out there. I also didn't sleep well last night, so I'm not 100% sure I'm going to get you there in one piece, but I'll do my best.\u201d Or the surgeon you hired to operate on your mom, and you hear, \u201cSorry, my surgery team today is a little sketchy. That one guy is brand new, my nurse is stressed because her kid got suspended, and personally, I'm just not feeling it today.\u201d You'd run away, right? And well you should. No one, I repeat, NO ONE, wants to do business with anyone who is less than 100% convinced, committed, and confident. There are simply too many other options out there. So what if you're not 100% convinced, committed, and confident? Well, you've got to get there. It starts with that decision, the decision that you're going to be a professional, whatever it takes. Now you know what the difference between a professional and an amateur is. A professional doesn't make any excuses. A professional takes responsibility. A professional takes control of his or her destiny and realizes that success or failure is up to one person only: him or herself. Can you make that decision right now? I want you to really think about it. Think through what it means to take full responsibility. You can no longer blame your manager. You can no longer blame your marketing department. You can't blame your products or the economy or the rotten leads. It's YOU, period. Are you ready to do that? If so, then I want you to write down in your workbook, on a paper, the back of your business card or in your planner or wherever, \u201cI AM A PROFESSIONAL. I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY PERFORMANCE AND FOR MY RESULTS.\u201d Got it written down? Don't do it if you're not ready. It's much better to be honest with yourself than to try to fudge it or lie about it. Just be honest. Once you've made the decision to be responsible for your performance and your results, the next step is to commit to 100% effort. You have to be all in. This is not the game for the weak at heart. If you can't give 100%, then you need to rethink whether or not you are truly a professional. I know you have other stuff in your life-a family, maybe a parent you're taking care of, whatever. I'm not saying that your work has to take up 100% of your time. I'm saying you have to be 100% committed to being a success, to making this job work. The crazy thing is, and I've seen it over and over again, when someone makes this decision to be a professional and then commits to it 100%, it affects other areas of their life as well. Suddenly they realize that they were not completely committed to their marriage. That they were giving 50% at the gym. That they were a lousy husband, a lousy friend, a lousy son or daughter. Now let me be clear... most of you here don't consider yourself lousy. You might even listen to me right now and say, \"No, you've got it wrong. I'm a great person. I go to church. I donate to orphans. I go to my kid's piano recital and call my mom once a week.\" And you know what, you are probably doing better than most of the other people out there. But are you on the path for greatness? REALLY? Remember what we said-you cannot be great without 100% commitment. Steve Jobs didn't get to be great by taking 3-hour lunches and playing Candy Crush. Serena Williams didn't win 21 Grand Slam singles titles in tennis by going easy on her training sessions or showing up hung over. They achieved greatness by giving 100% effort every time they showed up at the office and at work. They remove all other options and devote themselves to learning everything they can about their professions. Is it unrealistic to expect 100% commitment every day? Let me answer that with another question: Is it unrealistic to expect someone to achieve greatness WITHOUT 100% commitment? Remember, whenever you commit yourself to any line of action, you will get immediate results. When you're not committed all the way, you'll find the results are delayed or nonexistent. Now, that doesn't mean you're going to perform at 100% every day-that's impossible. Even Tiger Woods and Serena Williams have bad days, or bad seasons. But they show up and do the best they can with what they have that day and each and every day, no excuses. That's what makes you a professional. If you feel a little \u201ciffy\u201d on this one, you've got some work to do. Earlier, we went through some exercises about your commitment and your belief. Go review those and see where you need to pick things up. Do you need to convince yourself that you are in the right job? Do you need to research your company's offerings and make a case for how yours are superior to your competitors'? Whatever you need to do, DO IT! You will NOT be able to move forward and execute until you've covered this base. Be honest, brutally honest, and figure out where you're lacking. Then create a plan to address it. You MUST do this before you can execute. 2. The 10X Plan Once your mind is right, you can move forward to the next stage: Planning. Earlier, we talked about how you can be assured of your ability to achieve any goal by determining what the reasonable effort to achieve that goal would be and then 10Xing that. But before you can take massive action, you have to know what you're aiming for! This is where a lot of people make mistakes. They think, \u201cAha! I'll set goals that are totally doable, and then when I 10X it and blow past the end zone, I'll look like a champ!\u201d That's cheating yourself. Frequently and regularly, most of us have been warned against setting goals \u201ctoo high.\u201d But the reality is that if you start small, you are probably going to stay small. People's failure to think big enough usually means they will never act big enough, often enough, or persistently enough! After all, who gets excited about so-called realistic goals? Your goals have to light a fire in you. They have to make you drool just a little bit and make you question your sanity! If you don't set a goal that makes at least one person tell you that you're crazy, your goals aren't big enough. So your first step is to name and claim your goal. I choose objectives that seem just out of reach. It turns on the fighter in me, the part of me that says, \u201cI can do this if I commit every day.\u201d I don't want to set goals that I know I'm going to get. There's no point in that. Ask yourself whether the goals you have set are equal to your potential. Most people will admit that their goals are well below their potential- because most of the world has been convinced, persuaded, and even educated to set small, attainable, and realistic goals. Never set realistic goals; you can already get a realistic life without setting any goals. So right now, pick a goal. Ideally, it's related to work. You want to double your production this year. You want to break the seven-figure mark. You want to pay off all your debts. Whatever it is, WRITE IT DOWN. Make sure it makes your stomach turn just a little bit. That's how you know it's worth going for. Next, figure out what level of action you could reasonably assume would get you to your goal. For instance, let's say your goal is to double your production by the end of the month. You're currently producing $50,000 a month, so next month, you want that to double to $100,000. Is it a stretch? Good. Now, what level of activity would get you there? If you're currently calling 25 leads a week and you're generating $50,000 a month, let's say that's 100 leads a month for $500 a lead. The math here is easy. To double production, you're going to have to call 200 leads a month, or 50 a week. Easy enough, right? But wait... we need to 10X that. That means you're going to go for 2,000 leads a month, or 500 a week. Does that make you freak out? I can hear the questions already: \u201cWait, I don't have enough hours in the day to call that many people... you're crazy! What if they all want appointments? What am I going to do? I might have to hire an assistant... or do group appointments...\u201d GOOD! You know what we just did? We created NEW PROBLEMS for you, which means we're taking MASSIVE ACTION. If you remember, the hallmark of massive action is when you leave your OLD problems behind and give yourself a whole new set of problems. You're on the right track! You've identified your goal, you've laid out what 10X effort looks like, and you've started thinking about the new problems you've created and how you might solve them. That's right where you need to be. Okay, so here's your assignment right now: Figure out what REASONABLE effort it would take to reach your new goal. Then 10X that. Write it down and also write down any new problems that start coming to you. Do it right now. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "The 10X Execution",
    "text": "The 10X Execution Commitment-and even commitment plus a plan-means nothing if it isn't followed with action. I think about one of my clients whose business was struggling. We were talking and he said, \u201cMan, I'm going to turn this thing around. I'm committed to doing whatever it takes.\u201d I knew he had to lay some people off and make some tough internal organizational changes to cut costs, stuff that wasn't going to be easy. So I followed up with him about a week later to see how it was going and he was like, \u201cYeah, I'm still working on that.\u201d He hadn't done ANYTHING. That's not commitment, that's a prayer-one that probably won't be answered. You have to be committed, and you have to follow that commitment with ACTION. If no action follows, it wasn't a real commitment. So once you've committed, and once you have a plan, you've got to work the plan. You've got to execute. You might expect that I'd use this time to talk about sales and negotiation strategy, or give you the secret words to make any prospect sign any contract. Well, not today! You'll have to come back to another training to get that! Today I wanted to lay the groundwork so you have the correct framework for what success looks like and what it takes to get there. What we will cover in this section is some can't-miss basics for execution. The truth is, massive action in the right direction will trump sales skills and polish every time. That's why the first thing I want to recommend you do is to KEEP IT SIMPLE. Sales is a contact sport. It's about finding the person who can buy, who has the power to decide, and who's interested. Then you approach them with an offer, talk price, and make an ask. It's really that simple, though not always easy. The most successful salespeople focus on simplifying their sales process. If you get all complicated, you're going to get lost and get so worried about what stage of the buying process your lead is in that you lose sight of the fact that a human being is sitting on the other side of the table from you. Don't worry about being rough. Get out there before you're ready. You can compensate for a lack of polish by taking MASSIVE ACTION, but the reverse is NOT true. Who wins: The rough and ready salesperson who lacks skill but makes up for it in enthusiasm and volume, or the \u201cpolished' guy who sits in his office by himself and waits for his phone to ring? And when you start getting the volume going, you can't help but become better at what you're doing. In fact, when you start taking notes on every exchange you have with your clients, their objections, and questions, you'll learn an irreplaceable skill: The Power of Prediction. To predict is to know what's going to happen next. When you take enough action and spend enough time reviewing the exchanges you have with leads and customers, you're going to start to know what they're going to say and what they're going to ask before they even ask it! You're going to become more and more sure of how to handle each interaction, and how the prospect will react in turn. You're going to be able to predict objections and handle them before they even surface! It's going to be like things are in slow motion and you know what everyone's doing and saying and what they're going to do and going to say next. You're going to be in the ZONE. This is the same phenomenon that Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky talk about- knowing exactly where the ball's going to go or skating to the exact spot the puck is going to be next. It comes from one thing and one thing only: experience. And experience comes from massive action. You have to start looking at everything that's happening, observe it accurately without emotion or blame, and make a note of it. Assume responsibility for what's going on around you, and believe that you can control it. Pay complete attention, make notes of each and every encounter, and review them for patterns. Once you start sensing patterns, you'll be able to predict. It's really that easy and fast. But you have to pay attention, and you have to write it down. There are no shortcuts! To know is critical to success, as knowledge equals power in life. The ability to predict is one of the first benefits from committing all the way. You'll become responsible, aware, alert and solution-oriented. You'll become a professional. 4."

If you want to take a trip, you've got to get in the car and put your foot on the gas. If you want to build a house, you've got to pour concrete and pound nails. If you want to win the lottery, you've got to buy a ticket. To get results, there's no way around it: You MUST take action. The amount of success you have is limited only by the amount of action you take. Make it a discipline in every area.

    "subsection_topic": "Trust in the Process",
    "text": "Trust in the Process For a moment, imagine what your job would be like if you had to approach every customer, every deal, or every proposal completely differently. How much time that would take-and how much trial and error would you have to go through to get it right? Let's start by throwing that idea out the window. Closing a deal is a system-a process- like building a house from the ground up. Go through the same steps every time, and you'll end up with an end result that anyone would be proud of. In fact, one of the biggest mistakes salespeople make is that they don't trust in any kind of system or process when they're trying to make a sale. That's where the Perfect Sales Process comes in. Each of its five steps are physical, measurable milestones that you'll take to move a customer from considering your product all the way to taking delivery. Here's the catch: Miss any step of this process, and it simply won't work, like trying to build a house without first pouring the foundation. At the end of the day, shortcuts cost you time and money-and you won't need them. So, as we approach these steps, I'm going to ask you to trust the process and commit to doing these five steps in order. Before we dive into the specific steps, I want to talk a little about how the Perfect Sales Process was developed, and the ideas that it's based on. Within the last 50 years, there's been very little change in the way people sell things. Maybe you've been exposed to some of the dated sales material that's out there, which encourages you to spend long periods of time with your buyers, on the assumption that the longer you spend with them, the more indebted they become. People have changed over the last 50 years-in many ways. For example, wives are making more of the decisions about what to buy and how much money to spend. Today, both husbands and wives are more likely to have jobs outside the home. People feel like they have less time, and they have access to much more information. And some might argue that the internet has created a widespread shift in which buyers don't even want to engage a human being when making a purchase. So, in creating the Perfect Sales Process, Grant knew this process would have to do four things: 1. Be fast and easy for the buyer, and easy and effective for the salesperson. 2. Provide credible information as easily as the buyers can access it themselves. 3. Treat the buyers as an informed person, knowing they have access to knowledge. 4. Ultimately, satisfy the customer and the company by closing a sale. Now if you've done any previous training with us, maybe you're familiar with the fact that we used to teach a 13-step sales process. In today's world, buyers are always thinking about how much time they're going to spend, and no one wants to get stuck with someone they don't want to spend time with. So Grant shortened and simplified everything into the five-step Perfect Sales Process you're going to learn today. During this process, you're going to find out the following about the buyers: Who are they? What do they want? Why do they want it? What do I have that will fulfill their wants and needs? How do I show it to them, \"so that you can make sense of it, make an offer that you're willing to pay for, and then close, deliver, and follow up, in hopes to repeat this process again with you and others?\" Ideally, the sales process is rather shorter than longer. You as the salesperson are sensitive to the client's time, willing to spend as much time as necessary but never interested in wasting it. The buyer can get in and out as quickly as necessary or spend as much time as needed to get comfortable enough to make a decision. At the end of the day, Cardone Enterprises believes that an ideal sales process should satisfy these three parties, in this order: 1) the customer, 2) the salesperson, and 3) management. Now, maybe you've experienced the opposite, that many sales programs are designed to satisfy management first. However, in reality, management isn't buying the product and, in most cases, isn't selling it. And here's the real kicker: If the process you're using can't jump the first two hurdles of satisfying the customer and the salesperson, it won't be effective for management-no matter how much management wants it- because both buyers and salespeople will resist it. In other words, it doesn't matter how much the owner or upper management wants something done a certain way. If it doesn't work for the customer and the day- to-day user (that's you!), it will fail everyone! After customizing sales programs for organizations of all sizes and impacting hundreds of thousands of people and organizations worldwide, Grant created this powerful, succinct, and proven selling process. It's the shortest path from Point A to Point B, so you won't waste anyone's time in executing it, and you'll still hit all the important milestones you need to accomplish. The most important feature of this system, in my opinion, is that you could reveal every piece to your customers. In other words, you could pull back the curtain on every step of this process and still feel good about it. Why does that matter? At Cardone Enterprises, we believe that the transparency of our sales process is a vital litmus test for its integrity. This process is not about tricking your buyers or manipulating them. The best salespeople are straight shooters. They don't play games, they tell it like it is, and they know how to get the job done without tricks. The Perfect Sales Process, and our training today, will show you exactly how to get it done. 2."

    "text": "The Five Steps of the Perfect Sales Process Now that we've covered the foundation of the Perfect Sales Process-the \u201cwhy\u201d it was built around and its ultimate outcomes-let's zoom in a little more and talk about the specifics. Within the Perfect Sales Process, there are five steps that you must go through in every sales situation, whether it be in person, on the phone, or over the internet: Step 1: Greet The goal of the greeting is to introduce yourself, make a good impression, and put the buyer at ease. Your greeting sets the stage for the remaining steps. It opens the door to the reason we're there: to move the prospect into becoming a buyer. After your greeting, you'll immediately transition into... Step 2: Determine Wants and Needs In this step, you'll discover what your buyer wants and needs-and why. The outcome in this step is twofold: 1) to know what product to show your client and 2) to know how to present the product in a manner that will build value in that presentation and drive them to take action. Then, you'll move into... Step 3: Select Product and Present/Build Value Based on what you found out in the first two steps, you should now be able to select and present a solution, as well as demonstrate how it will benefit your buyer. Using the information your buyer shared in Step 2, you'll focus your presentation on what's important to that particular person, creating urgency and increasing the desire for your buyer to give you money for the product you are offering. Then, you'll head into... Step 4: Make Proposal As we'll discuss today, this is a step you probably already do, but you don't do it nearly enough. So although we're going to talk about the mechanics of delivering a proposal, we're also going to talk about the mindset shift of making a proposal to everyone you greet. I'll show you why this is so critical, when we cover this step in detail. Once you present your proposal, you'll move into... Step 5: Close Closing the transaction is a completely different art from selling. You have to be prepared to do it-and you have to be prepared to do it well. But here's the great news: Once you hone the art of closing, it creates confidence in your ability to handle all the objections, stalls, and problems you might encounter, which will only increase your confidence to do more selling. Approach this skill like you would if you were attempting to get a third-degree black belt, and you'll become a better salesperson overall. As you start to put this system into action, your first goal is to memorize these five steps by heart. I want you to be able to recite them backward and forward, both by name and with the associated meaning. That's going to be your first piece of homework as you take this system back to work and start to put it into practice. Then, as you're working through the process, make sure you always know exactly where you are within the Perfect Sales Process-and where you need to go next. Now, there's one more key to making this system work, and it starts with you. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "Commitments: The Key to Making the System Work",
    "text": "Commitments: The Key to Making the System Work If you really want to make the Perfect Sales Process work, I'm going to need something from you: a set of commitments. If you're not willing to make them, I'm going to give it to you straight: The Perfect Sales Process just isn't going to work for you. But if you're willing to make these eight commitments, I can practically guarantee that this system will help you close more deals. So, let's talk about what these commitments are: Commitment #1: Learn these steps by heart. I want you to know them inside and out, so you can hit every single step and transition easily between them. That's when the system is really going to start to work for you. Commitment #2: Know the purpose of each step and know the benefits to the customer first. Make sure you know, for yourself, the \u201cwhy\u201d behind each of these steps. It will help you move through the steps with much greater fluidity. Commitment #3: Commit to every step. Commit to all the steps, and commit to doing them with every customer, every time, every day, regardless of the situation. Otherwise, this system just simply isn't going to work for you. I also want you to commit to practicing them until you're what we call \u201cfluid, not mechanical.\u201d When you're learning something new, you're not fluid. You're awkward. Have you ever seen someone learn to surf? Or skateboard? Or dance? There's nothing fluid about it. When you first start to use this system, you're going to be mechanical. Moving customers through the steps will feel awkward. So you'll need to get very, very fluid, and the only way to get fluid is through repetition, training, education, and practice. Keep at it and you'll hit your stride. Commitment #4: Always get answers to every question you ask. This is a massive problem I see with salespeople across the board. Make it a personal rule that when you ask a question you always, always, always get an answer. Why? Because if you can't get people to answer your questions, you can't close them. So if I ask a man for his name, and he doesn't answer me, I'm going to say, \u201cSir, your name please?\u201d And if he doesn't answer, I'll follow up with, \u201cForgive me, sir, your first name?\u201d If you can't control the asking of questions and the receiving of answers, you're in trouble. If you're not persistent about getting answers to questions that you ask, you will never control the sale, you will never build trust, and you will never close the deal. People that don't talk to you will not buy from you. And one more distinction: If one of the answers you get is, \u201cI don't know,\u201d you need to realize that's not an answer. So, let's say you ask, \u201cAre you going to be paying for this at one time or over a period of time?\u201d and your customer says, \u201cI don't know,\u201d you have to follow up. Commit to getting that answer. Here's how it might go: You: \u201cWell, what would you prefer doing if you were going to make a decision right now?\" Your buyer: \u201cYou know, I really don't know yet.\u201d \u201cI understand. How'd you do it last time?\u201d \u201cWe made payments last time.\u201d \u201cAnd the time before that?\" \u201cWe made payments.\u201d \u201cAnd the time before that?\u201d \u201cWe made payments.\u201d At this point, I think it's safe to say that you have your answer-but only because you committed to getting it. Commitment #5: Always handle the customer's originations and objections. \u201cThe weather's terrible today\u201d is an origination. Handle it with a simple, \u201cI agree with you.\u201d Or maybe your customer has an objection, like \u201cI don't need to drive it.\u201d Don't act like it didn't happen. Handle it: \u201cSir, I totally understand you don't need to drive it. You know what? I'll tell you what. I'll drive it. You will be the passenger.\" Or to put it another way, your customer is saying, \u201cHey [insert your name], I don't want to dance with you.\u201d Your answer? \u201cNo problem. How about we have a drink instead?\" Deal with the origination. Acknowledge it. If it's an objection, handle it. We'll talk more today about exactly how to do that. Commitment #6: Always be positive with everything you do. \u201cCan do,\u201d \u201cno problem\u201d-that kind of attitude is contagious. It's everything to you, your career, your happiness, and your bank account. That's why you need to work on your training every day. Consult it before and after deals to keep you sharp. If you've ever lost a deal, your attitude drops. That's when you want to go get it fixed, immediately. Don't wait for three days. Get back to your training, fix your attitude, and keep it positive. Commitment #7: Always agree with your customer. This is the first rule of selling. If you've been through Sales Success from the Ground Up, you already know this rule: Always agree with the customer-because if you don't agree with people, you can't handle all their points of resistance. If you can't handle the points of resistance, you will not control the sales process, and you will not make it through the steps and close the deal. Commitment #8: Always approach each of the steps from the mode of service. People do business with people they like. Agreed? People do business with people they like and feel good around. Agreed? People do business with people they like, feel good around, trust. And they're more likely to do business with me and pay me because they feel good around me. Those are the benefits of approaching these steps from the mode of service. Those are your eight commitments. We're going to work with them just a little bit more before we move on to the next section. PART 2: SETTING THE FOUNDATION: ATTITUDE 1."

    "section_topic": "Setting the Foundation: Attitude",
    "subsection_topic": "What Is Attitude?",
    "text": "What Is Attitude? What exactly is attitude? Attitude means your mental disposition-your feeling or position toward something or someone. Your attitude is your X factor. It's what makes you unique. Now, your attitude can be negative or neutral, good or great. But to sell, you need one attitude: A great attitude. Bad, neutral, or even good isn't going to work for you. Without a great attitude, you have zero chance of closing a deal. Here's what's so interesting about attitude: You need a great attitude before you ever meet a customer, before you pick up a phone, before you send out a letter, before you get on your laptop to send an email. Your attitude can literally be felt over an email, can't it? So before you handle an appointment, take a call, or physically greet a customer, you have to make sure you have a great attitude. After all, without the right attitude, the five steps of the Perfect Sales Process don't even matter. Now, agree or disagree: People typically don't buy from people they don't feel good around. Now if they DO buy and they don't feel good around you, they're going to make a decision on what? Price. So if you want to ensure that you get the lowest price for your product-that's right, the lowest price every time-go ahead: Keep your negative or neutral attitude. However, if you want every chance to get the highest price for your product or service, cultivate the most positive attitude that you can possibly have. And that's about standing in a state of confidence, knowing deep in your gut that you're going to sell the customer. Attitude will determine how far you ultimately get in life, not just in the job you're in. It will also determine whether or not you're happy in life. Hard work alone will not ensure that you get far in life. And even if hard work helps you achieve certain things, without a great attitude, you can still be miserable. Because if you have a neutral or negative attitude, hard work will just be hard work. Cultivate a great attitude. It will change everything. Now, once you agree that a positive attitude is absolutely necessary, a couple of items you need to complete the package: Dress like a winner. Don't dress to be comfortable. Dress like you're a professional. Dress like you're going after a million dollars or a hundred million or even a billion. Carry yourself like a winner, like you're Tony the Tiger or Tom Brady- anyone who's at the absolute top of his or her game. Even when things get tough, carry yourself like a winner. Have that light in your eyes. Have you ever met somebody who literally has light beams coming out of his or her face? Try to project that same kind of light when communicating with people. Next, put a smile on your face at all times. Your buyers might say things like: \"We're not buying today. We can't afford it. We're not doing it. We're going to wait until the economy returns,\" My response goes like this. \"I understand. I understand you're not buying today. I understand the economy's bad. I understand you're on a budget. I understand you don't feel good. I understand.\" Always keep doing this. Last, you need service in your heart. When I go and meet with a client, I'm not thinking, \u201cI've got to sell the client.\" I'm thinking about service in my heart. It doesn't matter for me whether I'm picking up my child, asking a woman to go out with me for the first time, or selling a customer a $10 book: I want service in my heart. You have to make the decision to approach every scenario like that. And when you have service in your heart, you'll have a smile on your face. You'll stand up differently-and you'll have a great attitude. In fact, service is such a necessary part of your sale, that I'm going to take a few minutes to focus on it. 2."

    "text": "Keeping Service in Your Heart An attitude of service lets people know they're being taken care of, not being taken advantage of and not being taken for granted. To be a successful salesperson, you need to concern yourself with your customer first. What do they get? How do they win? How do they benefit? Notice that I'm not talking about what YOU get out of the sale. What do THEY get? How do they win? If you have that in your heart, they're going to know it. And look, if you take care of enough other people, I promise you you're going to be taken care of. But it has to be genuine, and it requires some trust on your part. I want you to think that if you approach a sale with enough service in your heart-if you really, really take care of people-it will pay off. I think, deep down, most of you believe that. Am I right? So what about those who give up on this idea of service and giving? Have you ever made this mistake or seen someone else who did? [FACILITATOR: Optional: If applicable, add \u201cI've made this mistake\u201d and share your story.] That's the path to failure. Maybe you've tried this \u201cservice thing\u201d and you didn't get results. There are four reasons that might happen: 1. You didn't stay with it long enough. 2. You came up just short of really, really serving people. 3. You weren't genuine in your service. You were doing it to serve your own desires- like getting a bigger paycheck-not from a desire to authentically, genuinely care and service. 4. You quit being interested in the service angle. It just doesn't work if you lose interest in serving a client. I've heard it said that the only way to be a real master is to first become a master at being a servant. People don't want to be sold. People want to be serviced. People want to be taken care of. Will they need help making a decision? Of course. They don't know the product like you do and they came to you for assistance. Will they need you to help them close? Absolutely. But without that quality of service, without you taking care of them, without you really giving into, \u201cI'm here to assist, not just sell,\u201d you're probably not going to get to the close. Service is an action word. Service means to be useful or of some value, help, aid, or assistance to another. You should never ever have to tell a customer that you want to be of service to them. Why would you tell them? Your actions should speak for themselves. I'd never tell someone, \u201cI want to get you a glass of water.\u201d I'd just get it for them. Or maybe your customer asks for information. Service-oriented salespeople would respond with, \u201cI'd be happy to get that for you, sir. I'm going to get you this, and this, and I'm going to get you this, and I'm going to get you the warranty, and I want to get you the payments, and I want to get you terms, and I want to show you the lenders we're using.\u201d In other words, you want to be of so much service that your customers don't have to ask for anything. You want to overwhelm them with service. When you make your attitude one of service, the selling will take care of itself. 3. How to Deliver a Great Attitude-Verbally Now that you understand why a positive attitude is so important, I want to dive into the \u201chow.\u201d How do we deliver a great attitude, day in and day out? It's not an esoteric concept, really, and you don't have to talk to yourself in the mirror or go on some kind of long retreat to cultivate it. Instead, a great attitude is about getting your head on right and understanding how to communicate positively. I'm talking about eliminating things like \u201cI can't\u201d and \u201cwe won't\u201d from your vocabulary and replacing them with things like, \u201cCan do. Excellent. No problem. You got it. Be happy to. Great. Hey, whatever you want, I'm here to get it for you. Look, I'm here to serve you, not sell you. I agree with you, sir. You're right. I love that idea.\u201d All of these phrases communicate a great attitude. By the way, you don't have to feel good to have and project a great attitude. Maybe you've got a 102-degree temperature. Maybe you're getting over the flu. Maybe your girlfriend or your boyfriend left you. So what? Have a great attitude anyway. Communicate that great attitude-and the easiest way for you to deliver that is verbally. A great attitude is also the best way to stand out from your competition. Think about it this way: You've probably got at least four other people selling something similar. Three of them will sell it for cheaper. How do you get people to buy from you? Here's your edge: I am so positive. I've got light coming out of my eyes. Everything they say that's negative, I'm coming out positive: \u201cHey, be happy to. No problem. We can do it. I'd be happy to get that for you. I understand how you feel.\u201d When the rest of the world is negative, you'll be like a bright star. Because let's face it, there are very few people on this planet who are positive. A majority of the population is actually negative. So when, all of a sudden, you meet somebody who goes around with an attitude of: \u201cHey, I can do that. Oh, no problem. Oh, you've only got ten minutes? That's more than enough time,\u201d that person stands out. Just like everything else we'll discuss today, you want to practice these positive phrases so that you can communicate a great attitude, regardless of how you feel, regardless of what's going on. Then you can deliver to your customers something they can actually experience. Because, at the end of the day, you don't just need to change your attitude, you have to change theirs, too. 4."

    "subsection_topic": "Your Attitude Is a Reflection",
    "text": "Your Attitude Is a Reflection Now that you know what you're going to say to project a great attitude, let's talk about the biggest question we get at our Cardone Enterprises seminars: How do you KEEP it? How do you stay positive? It's a great question. Here's our take: Your attitude is determined by your thoughts: what's going on in your head. And your thoughts are determined by the content of your mind. And the content of your mind is determined by the environment around you. That includes newspapers, TV, radio, your friends, the people you live and work with, etc. So when it comes to your attitude, it's a reflection, just like your body. Your body is a reflection of what you put in it and how you take care of it, right? Your mind is the same thing. Whatever is going in your head is going to come out of your mouth. So how do you stay positive all the time? You control the content of your mind. You control what goes into your head. If you've got angry content in your mind, you're going to project what? An angry attitude. If you've got apathetic, quitter, give-up, no-solution content, you're going to probably have what? An apathetic, lazy, lethargic, \u201cI've got no juice\u201d attitude. But if you have positive, solution-oriented, can-do content in your mind, what are you going to communicate? A great attitude: \u201cNo problem. You've got it. I'd be happy to.\u201d Now, here's a great example of this: How many of you browsed the news today? Now, I'm just going to read you a few headlines from this morning. What do you notice? Most of it suggests you should be upset, that there's a conspiracy going on somewhere in the world, or that you should just give up because there's no solution to anything. If this is how you start your day every day, no wonder you're feeling negative. And this is coming at us nonstop, 24/7-all negative content. By the way, this isn't a political statement. It doesn't matter whether you're listening to the right or to the left. They both share plenty of negative content. So if you really want to stay positive, you've got to choose better content. Here's one easy way to do it: Surround yourself with positive books. Keep them all over your house. Next to your bed, in your bathroom, anywhere you can grab them. Did you know that when you read something that you don't know, you actually generate curiosity-and when a person becomes curious, they're interested in learning more? In other words, if I actually taught you more, you'd be interested in learning more. Conversely, the less you learn, the less interested you are in learning. So who do you think is more excited? The person who's learning or not learning? That's the power of keeping positive, interesting books around. So what does this all roll up to? Your life and your career depend on your attitude. Control your environment and what goes into your head, and you can shape your attitude in any direction you want. 5."

    "subsection_topic": "Seven Tricks for Staying Positive",
    "text": "Seven Tricks for Staying Positive Now, in addition to controlling what goes into your head, I have seven other tricks to help you stay positive through some simple actions you can take every day. As I walk you through these, I want you to pick out two that you're going to implement in the next week, so think about that as I share this list with you: 1. Write down your goals each morning, and write them as though they're already yours. For example, \u201cI sold X products this month. I made Y in commission. I own a helicopter. I just bought a lake house in Italy.\" Whatever your goals and dreams are, keep writing them down every morning. Keep putting them in the physical universe until all your attention starts moving to those things that you want. 2. Work out every day. Move your body for ideally 30 minutes, but if you can't get more than ten minutes in, get ten minutes in. Move in the direction of health because it will make you feel positive. Think about it this way: If you wake up at 6:00 and finish your workout at 6:30, you've already accomplished more than what 90% of the entire population on planet Earth has. And listen to positive stuff during that workout- information, knowledge, music, anything that makes you feel good. 3. Finish things left undone. That stack of paper on your desk, that mail that you haven't sent out, the bill that you haven't paid yet: They're all killing you because they lock up attention units. Leaving things unfinished can also get you in a mindset where you start believing things like, \u201cI don't finish projects. I don't complete cycles of action. I don't accomplish things.\" That's not a positive place to be, so just start knocking things out, out one by one. 4. Treat everyone with a great attitude. Go out of your way to help someone else or make somebody else feel good. Maybe you see a woman struggling with her bag on the plane. Volunteer to help: \"Can I help you with your bag, ma'am?\" What does that do to the people around you? More importantly, what does it do for you? It instills a sense of contribution, a feeling that you're helping the people around you. 5 Make a gratitude list on a daily basis. That will start shifting your thinking. What do you have to be grateful for? Everybody's got something. You've got enough resources at your disposal to be here right now, so I guarantee you've got something to be grateful for. You're actually studying material right now to change your attitude. That's something to be grateful for. Find these things and list them daily. 6. Put a sign up in your office. You can put something like \u201cNO NEGATIVITY ALLOWED\u201d on your wall, and take a stand on negativity. You can even point to the sign and say, \u201cLook, negativity isn't allowed here. I don't want it in my environment.\u201d So the next time one of your coworkers, a manager, a fellow employee, or an executive comes in and starts saying, \"Business sucks, this is a problem, and that's a problem,\u201d you can point to the sign and cut the conversation off immediately. Because you can't afford it. It is killing you. You think sales training costs money? A bad attitude will cost you millions of dollars over your lifetime. And if you're surrounded by it, it might be time to make a change. 7. Get rid of the people in your life that are not positive. Reach up. Don't reach down to your peers. Reach up. Find people that are positive, find people that are creating wealth, success, happiness, taking care of their bodies, etc. and make them a part of your life. Get rid of the negative people in your life. And if you can't get rid of them completely, control your environment. Use the sign, use whatever you need to keep negativity at a minimum. The best thing you can do for yourself-the single thing that will make the biggest difference in the success of your life-is to reach up and grab yourself a positive attitude. These strategies will get you started. I want you to commit to implementing two of these in the next week. On page [FACILITATOR: Share page number], circle the two that you're going to put into action. Ideally, I'd love to see you start these tomorrow. Which two are you going to adopt first? I'll give you a second to mark them. [FACILITATOR: Pause to allow them to complete this.] 6."

    "text": "Wrap-Up: The Most Important Sale You Will Ever Make Finally, there's one more distinction I want to cover on this topic before we dive into the Perfect Sales Process. Earlier in the day, we talked about what determines your attitude: Your attitude is determined by your thoughts: What's going on in your head. And your thoughts are determined by the content of your mind. So if your attitude comes down to the content of your mind, it only makes sense that the biggest, most important sale you will ever make in your lifetime is the one you make to yourself. Because if you can't sell yourself-if your mind isn't utterly sold on your product, your company, and yourself-how can you possibly have the right attitude to sell anyone else? So let me ask you: Are you sold on your product? Are you sold on your company? Are you sold on yourself? If you cannot, unequivocally, answer 100% \u201cyes\u201d to those questions, you will suffer. At the end of the day, you have to be completely, unequivocally, totally overboard, unreasonably, fanatically sold on your product, sold on your company, and sold on you. What do you love about your product? Why is your product worth the hundred grand? Why should people go into debt over it? Why should people actually pay more than they can actually afford for your product? What are all the ways people benefit? How many different things do they get from your product? You have to stay constantly connected to how sold you are on that product. Not how your customers are sold on it, but how YOU are sold on it. You have to do the same thing regarding your company. What are all the benefits of your company? What have they done to invest in their people? What does your company do for your customer that you need to know about? And then, what about you? How do you do? How do you go the extra mile? Why should you earn the sale? How are you going to show up differently than other people? Why should they be willing to give you that commission? Why you? Look, if you don't have answers to these questions burned into your heart, you'll never have the right attitude-and you won't fully become a champion. Because that's what this is about. Making you a champion, a master-and making whatever goal or goals you have achievable and real. Part 3: Steps of The Sales Process - Step 1: Greet 1."

    "subsection_topic": "Your Greeting Sets the Tone",
    "text": "Your Greeting Sets the Tone Welcome back! Now that we've covered the foundation that sets the tone for the Perfect Sales Process, we're going to dive into the five steps of the process. We'll start with Step 1, which is absolutely critical for closing the deal. In fact, blow this step and you'll blow the whole deal. Now, even though this step may only last a few seconds, it's going to set the tone for everything that comes afterward-but you've only got one shot. Whatever happens in these first few seconds can never be changed. That's why it's so important to be prepared-because you've got to do the greeting just right. When you look up \u201cgreeting\u201d in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the definition says: \u201cTo address with expression of kind wishes upon meeting or upon arrival.\u201d This gives us a guideline for what we want to achieve in this step: 1. We want to make people feel welcome. But that's not the only goal for this step. You also want to: 2. Introduce yourself and make yourself known to the customers. 3. Put the customers at ease so they start dropping their guard. 4. Get on common ground. 5. This next one is very, very important, yet it's not something a lot of people talk about a lot: You want to differentiate yourself from others they'll meet later and those they have already met. And you also want to differentiate yourself from any experiences people have had in the past with your product, your service, or your company. 6. Get the buyer to turn control over to you. Now, this word \u201ccontrol\u201d confuses a lot of people. So let me be clear: Your goal is to influence people to turn control over to you. You're not trying to take it from them. Ultimately, the greeting is the foundation for every step that follows this one. It's also a step that you must continue to perfect throughout your career. It's not something you learn once and move away from. So let's try our first greeting right now. I'll get us started: \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME].\u201d Try it now. Turn to the person next to you and try it on each other: \u201cWelcome, my name's...\u201d This is something you're going to practice until you feel fluid, not mechanical. Get that first phrase down. Because if you can't put people at ease, you're going to struggle with getting on common ground. And if you don't differentiate yourself, you'll never control the process. And when it comes to control, it's absolutely essential to selling. During a sale, you'll either have control or you won't control, period. There is no in-between. This will come naturally as a result of working the steps perfectly. Skip the steps in the Perfect Sales Process or let people talk you out of doing them, and I promise you, you will never ever have control-and control equals a close. It all starts with the right greeting. Let's work on perfecting yours. 2."

    "subsection_topic": "Three Steps to a Winning Greeting",
    "text": "Three Steps to a Winning Greeting There are rules to every game, and greetings are no different. Violate the rules, and you're going to lose. Play by the rules, or, even better, learn to manage those rules, and you're going to win. First, let's talk about the three steps in your greeting. I'm going to go through them quickly first so you get the flow, then I'm going to go back and break everything down for you: 1. Go to them. Don't have them come to you. You're going to go greet them, and you want to go further toward them than they're going to come to you. 2. You say, \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME].\u201d And you put your hand out and say, \u201cAnd yours?\u201d 3. Remember, they're there for them. They did not come for you. You need to know that. They're not interested in you. You need to be interested in them. Those are the three basic steps. Now let's go through a couple of nuances. \u2022 Step 1: Go to them The person that travels the furthest is the person most interested. They might have traveled 30 miles. You need to walk 30 feet. They've done all the work, so you have to go to them. Go greet your customer without rushing them. Show them, by your actions, that you're interested in them. \u2022 Step 2: You say, \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME].\u201d And you put your hand out and say, \u201cAnd yours?\u201d It's not, \u201cWelcome to our dealership\u201d or \u201cWelcome to our company.\u201d It's \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME],\u201d and then you put your hand out. Leave it there until they shake it. Make eye contact. Be present. Do you know what I mean when I say that? Show up and be there-nowhere else. Ask for their name, pay attention to that name, and duplicate that name over and over again in your conversation. Two more tips for you in this step: 1. Don't be offended by brush-offs. They're going to happen. Oftentimes, it's because the last salesperson that worked with them wasn't a professional. They see you as the same kind of person. It's not about you, so don't take it personally. 2. Give a firm handshake-no dead fish handshakes-and look your customer in the eyes. Make eye contact. Show interest. Have that light beaming out of your eyes and smile. See the deal before it happens. See the client buying your product and taking delivery. \u2022 Step 3: Remember that they're there for them. They didn't come for you. And as you keep this in mind, I've got one last rule to guide you: Every person who walks in the door should be treated like a buyer. Regardless of what they tell you, there is an opportunity with this client. Every prospect that you meet is an opportunity. One day, someday, somehow, some way, he or she will be a buyer. There is no exception to this rule. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "People Are Naturally Guarded",
    "text": "People Are Naturally Guarded Let's start by setting some context here. When people meet new people, they're naturally guarded, not wide open. Think of the last time you went into a car dealership, the dentist's office, or a lawyer's office for the first time. Did you feel comfortable? Probably not. Now, if you went there three, four, five, or six times and you knew everybody there, you'd feel a lot different, wouldn't you? So unless your customers visit you every day, they are not going to be in their comfort zone. That's why your job in the greeting is to make people comfortable, to put them at ease, to remove all defenses that they may have so that they don't continue to guard themselves. After all, when a person's guarded, you're not going to get on common ground with that person. You're not going to convince him or her to turn control over to you. You're not going to build trust and confidence. Let's talk about what \u201cguarded\u201d looks like. You open with: \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME].\u201d Note: Also put out your hand and smile to demonstrate the perfect greeting every time you repeat these phrases. \u201cAnd yours?\u201d And then you immediately start hearing things like, \u201cI'm not buying today. Leave me alone. I just want to look. We're not buying for three months. You'll be wasting your time. I just need a price, and I want to get out of here and go shop around. Do you have this? Do you have that? How much over invoice can you sell it to me for? What kind of discount can you give me? Can you match or beat this price I have in my hands?\u201d Ever encountered anything like that? If you've been doing this for more than five days, I bet you've heard all that before. But what you may not know is that these are just things that people say to you because they're on guard. We call them Reactionary Defense Responses or RDRs. They don't mean much. They're just reactions. All this, \u201cI'm not shopping,\u201d or \u201cI'm just looking, I'm not buying, we only have five minutes...\u201d those are RDRs. They're not objections. They're just automatic. They're not thought out. They're designed to defend and protect, and hopefully, make you lose interest in serving the customer. And let's be honest: Most of the time it works. But here's what I want you to know: Don't take them personally. They mean nothing. Always, always be positive when you hear these things, and just disregard them. Now \u201cdisregard\u201d does not mean \u201cdon't acknowledge them.\u201d I can acknowledge something and disregard it at the same time. Let me give you an example: Your customer says to you: \u201cHey, [FACILITATOR NAME], the weather sucks today.\u201d You say: \u201cHey, I understand.\u201d You don't have to go into a conversation about it. You can acknowledge it, then disregard it. But, no matter what, continue to show interest, regardless of what you hear. Let me repeat that: Show high levels of interest, no matter what your buyer says. It helps if you can understand and predict what you'll hear. Don't be caught off guard. Know that they're going to say, \u201cHey, I'm not buying today. We're just looking. We're just shopping. First place we've been to. Can you match this price? Can you beat this deal? I didn't bring my wife with me. I only have five minutes.\u201d Understand this and predict it. Then you can use it. Let's talk about how. 4."

    "text": "Handling Reactionary Defense Responses Now, before we dive deeper on RDRs, there's something you need to understand: You're not in the product business. You're not in the car business. You're not in the radio business. You're not in the insurance business. So if you're not in any of these businesses, what business are you in? You're in the people business. So you need to understand what's behind these statements. What causes people to say these things? Why do they have this reactionary response? Reactionary Defense Responses are a defense mechanism, an automatic response that's born out of your buyer's beliefs and complicated by their fears. They're thinking things like \u201cI can't trust these people\" and \"this guy won't tell me the truth.\" They've been ripped off before. Now, here's what's important to remember: This doesn't have anything to do with you. You're telling the truth. You're not the person who ripped them off before. However, you still need to take responsibility for the situation because you want to control the sales process. You need to solve this problem. Let's talk about the fears that make people feel defensive: 1. Pressure to buy. \"If I show interest, the salesperson is going to start pressuring me to buy today.\" This is a customer trying to protect him or herself. 2. Getting stuck for hours. \u201cIt's going to take too long. I only have ten or 15 minutes. I don't want to be here for two hours. The last time I came in, it took two hours.\" Have you ever avoided going to a party because you feel like you're going to get stuck there for hours? See, this is about human psychology. It's not just about selling. People feel like they're going to be obligated: \"If I show interest, if I spend time with this person, I'm going to be obligated if they show me their product.\" Or: \"If I go for a ride in it, I'm going to feel obligated that I'm going to have to be nice to them and I'm going to have to buy something.\" Understand? By the way, do you have family members who don't want to come buy from you? Maybe you've got an uncle who needs what you have, but he won't ever come down to see you. Do you know why? Because your uncle doesn't want to feel obligated. That's what's holding him back. He thinks, \"If I go and sit down with my nephew or niece and look at this proposal, I'm obligated to buy.\" This is a perfect example of a Reactionary Defense Response. And until you handle that, you're not going to be able to handle him. Let's talk about other fears your buyers are going through: 3. Making a decision. Decision making is more difficult for people than paying the money. They're scared to make the wrong decision. What's going on in their head? A loop that's all about fear: \"I didn't make the right decision. I'm going to feel like a fool later.\" 4 Overpaying. What's your customer worried about? \"I'm going to pay too much and get ripped off.\" 5 Financial insecurity. Your customer might even be thinking things like: \"I probably can't even afford it.\" This isn't the truth, by the way. You'll get a lot of people who come to you who can easily afford your products, but don't think they can. Now, why are we going through all of these fears? Because the only way to put people at ease is to know what's going on with them. And once you put people at ease, you can get on common ground and convince them to allow you to control the process. Assure them that they're in good hands. Address their fears, even when they're not stated. \"Look, you don't have to make a decision here today and you don't have to buy here today. My job is to service you.\" By the way, I'm starting to use some language that we're going to go over in more depth shortly. What about the person who's sensitive about time and comes in saying, \u201cHow long is this going to take?\u201d You could say, \u201cI'll get you everything you need in the next 20 minutes.\" And if they say: \"I only have 15.\" You could respond: \"I'll do it in 15.\" Why not? To sum this section up: 1. Your job is to put your buyer at ease by handling their RDRs. Realize that some of these RDRs are never spoken, but they're definitely projected. Handle them all. 2. Understand that what buyers say when they come in the door are RDRs. These are just a defense mechanism, nothing more than that. 3. Figure out what people need so that they can feel at ease. 4. Look at these common fears and create responses you can use for each one of them. These exist for every person that comes into your home or into your office. You need to be prepared to handle them. 5."

    "text": "Getting on Common Ground In this next section, we'll continue the process of breaking down every part of this step of the Perfect Sales Process, so you can understand it perfectly. More specifically, we'll move on to the next part of Step 1, which is about getting on common ground. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines common ground as \u201cthe basis of mutual interest or agreement.\u201d In plain English, it means that you and I have something in agreement. The keyword here is what? Agreement. You can't get on common ground with someone if you disagree with them. Maybe you've heard the phrase \u201copposites attract?\u201d In sales, it's just not true: Opposites never, ever attract. If you ever want to gain the other person's trust-as well as control of the sale-you have to get on common ground and establish some mutual interest or agreement without wasting his or her time. It's a challenge. Agreed? A lot of salespeople do it wrong by going out of their way to hunt for this thing called \u201ccommon ground\u201d with phrases like: \"Where do you live? Where do you work? How far did you drive today? Nice little kids you got there.\" These are hit or miss. People didn't come in to talk about where they live or their kids. That's not why they came in to see you. It's not authentic, it's not genuine, and they know it. So what happens? Most salespeople realize this isn't working so they skip getting on common ground, and they find they can't close the sale without it. We take a different approach. Let's think about what you have in common with every customer. Let's make a list. [FACILITATOR: Optional: Ask for input from the audience to make this list, either by asking them to contribute in the room or type into the chat in a virtual setting.] What do we each have in common with every other human being on planet Earth? There are 7.5 billion of us, last time I checked. We all have a heartbeat. We all have blood running through our veins. What else? Because the more we can find in common with people, the more we can communicate with them. Let's think about this more specifically in terms of your customers. What do you have in common with your customers? 1. They want information. You have it. 2. They want to get in and out. You want that too, if you're honest with yourself. You want them to come in, buy your product quickly, and get out of there, so you can go do it all over again. 3. They want to be sure that they don't make a bad decision. And you want to be sure too, although, for you, a bad decision would involve them buying somewhere else or not at all. 4. They don't want to be pressured. And if you don't have to pressure them, you don't want to do that either, right? 5. If you're selling them a car, they're probably going to be interested in things like price, payments, interest rates, and figures on the vehicle they're driving now. You don't think that you have that in common? If you don't give them those five things at some point today, you're not going to sell them anything. So you have that in common with your customer: You both want to get to the information stage. Maybe for different reasons, but you both want to get there. 6. Neither of you wants to waste your time. Look at all those things you have in common with the customer. What if you could put all that into one of the most effective greetings you could possibly use? What about something like this? \"Welcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME]. And yours? My job is to make sure you get all the information you need and to make sure you get the right product. I'm going to leave the decision making up to you, and I want to do it all in the shortest period of time possible.\u201d Learn this greeting and it can change your life. Now that you've got a greeting that will get you off on the right foot, I want to teach you the ultimate way to grab common ground. It's called \u201cInformation Assisted Selling.\u201d 6."

    "subsection_topic": "Using Information Assisted Selling",
    "text": "Using Information Assisted Selling Information Assisted Selling is a unique system, one that Grant Cardone has trademarked. It's something that has transformed entire industries, and it will position you head and shoulders above any competitor who refuses to use it. When you put Information Assisted Selling into action, your productivity will go through the roof, and you'll easily maintain control of the sales process. Here's what this system hinges on: What do customers who come in your door or enter your sales process have in common? What are they all coming for? Here's a hint: It's not you. It's information. Even when someone says they're \u201clooking for a salesperson,\u201d you need to understand what they're actually saying: They need information. Now, you might tell me that they're coming to buy your product. That's not entirely accurate. They're coming to get information so they can buy your product. Without the information first, they can't hook, they can't buy, and they can't make a decision. In fact, most sales processes break down because the organization does not want to give information. Let me repeat that: Most sales processes break down- and most salespeople do not succeed-for one reason. It's because the organization believes it should not give information. This is a mistake. Most salespeople fail because they don't get to the information phase. Your paycheck reflects the number of clients you can get into the information stage and then close. Information is good. No matter how many sales you made last month-I don't need to know the customers' names, I don't need to know the terms, I don't need to know how much money you made-I can still guarantee you one thing. Those people you sold? They all got information. Information is the ultimate common ground. Before you get nervous or confused, or run out and give people a ton of information, I need to tell you that you can't just give people information. You have to deliver it in a very specific way. In fact, we're going to use the offer of information separately from the actual giving of information. Stay with me here for a minute. Why do you want to separate the offer of information from the giving of that information? Here's one reason: You don't want to give information before you know you're offering the right product and before the customers are sold on that product. And you don't want to give it while we're standing up and walking around. Instead, you want to do it when you give your presentation or proposal. Think of it this way. Let's say I ask you something like: \u201cAre you interested in the weather? How about I tell you about tomorrow's weather forecast?\" And your customer says, \u201cAbsolutely. I want to know about tomorrow's weather forecast.\u201d Have I given them the information yet? No. I just offered it. If this were a TV show, the script would say something like: \u201cWe're going to go to a commercial break now, and we'll come back with tomorrow's forecast.\u201d In other words, we want to use information as the hook. Here's a greeting you could use: \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME]. And yours? What can I get you information on?\u201d Those of you who have attended a Cardone Enterprises seminar in the past will recognize this as a power greeting, where we take the information customers want and push it to the front of the process. To be clear, though, we're not talking about the giving of information, but the offering, this proactive, \u201cCan I get you information?\u201d This offer of information is what we use to break through the RDR, the customer's Reactionary Defense Response. That way, we can get on common ground quickly and convince the customer to give us control. Watch how this works: \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME]. And yours? What can I get you information on today?\u201d Your customer might say something like, \u201cUh, you want to give me information?\u201d You say something like: \u201cSure. Be more than happy to. I'd like to get you price, payments, down payments-everything you need.\u201d Do you see how that breaks the cycle? There's an interesting thing that happens. What I've used here to break the pattern is surprise. Most of you are not using surprise in your presentation. Advertisers know about surprise. It's a way to gain people's attention. You also interrupt what your customer thought they were going to see. And if I interrupt what people thought they were going to see or thought they were going to experience, I can generate some interest. Here's another example. At Cardone Enterprises, we're a training company. So what if we answered the phones like this? \u201cThank you for calling Cardone Enterprises. This is [FACILITATOR NAME]. What problem can I help you solve?\u201d Now, why would I use that opening? Because people call our office to solve problems. Right? The people who call us don't really want sales training. They only want sales training because they want to solve a problem. So by asking that question, you'll get to what your customers want as quickly as possible. Open the conversation with what you believe to be on their mind. And, remember, you're not on their mind. Information's on their mind. But I don't give information here, do I? I offer it. I'm looking for a yes, which looks like: \u201cWell, I'm looking for information on this and this.\u201d Or: \u201cI need help getting my sales team's numbers up.\u201d That's agreement and that's also common ground. Just remember this distinction: Separate the offering and the giving of information. They're separate things. They don't have anything to do with one another. We're offering information to get an agreement-common ground-and then you're going to transition into the next step. What's the next step? Does anyone remember? Determine Wants and Needs. The actual giving of information comes later-in Steps 3 through 5. Remember my example? \"Would you like to know what the weather's going to be like tomorrow?\" Again, I haven't given the forecast yet. Your customer says: \u201cYeah, I'd love to know what the weather is.\u201d Then you'd say something like: \"Great. I want to be sure that you get an accurate report of tomorrow's weather. By the way, where will you be tomorrow?\u201d See how easily we moved into determining wants and needs? Here's another example from a car dealership. \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME]. And yours? What can I get you information on?\u201d They say: \u201cOh, I want information on this car.\u201d You say, \u201cGreat. What do you want it to come equipped with?\u201d Or: \u201cAre there any other models you want information on as well?\u201d See, we've moved into wants and needs. You see what we're doing here? Offering to get information to get on common ground, then fact finding to determine wants and needs. Information gets you information. The offer, \u201cHey, what can I get you information on?\u201d immediately accomplishes a number of things. First, it's going to differentiate you from others in the greeting. Second, it's going to move you immediately into Step 2. You don't want to ever stop the sales process. You want to move it along, control it. Offering information puts you on common ground and it puts you in control, not by taking control, but because they'll want to give you control, which moves the process forward. We're in the information age here. We're also in the age of transparency. As I mentioned in the intro, selling has changed very little in the last 50 years. However, your customer's changed, the economy's changed, your competition's changed, and, as a result, you must change the way you handle customers. Information is free today. It's everywhere. The salesperson who most proactively and most professionally assists the client with the offering and delivery of information, satisfying the customers wants and needs, will position themself for the close and for the business. Period. Now, we're going to spend a little time practicing your greeting, but before we do that, I want to give you a few examples of great greetings. 7."

[FACILITATOR: As you deliver each of these, deliver the greeting with the right physicality and tone of voice, so students can use you as a model for delivering their own greetings. \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME]. And yours?\u201d [pause] \u201cJohn, great. What information can I get you while you're here?\" Do you see the smile, the posture, the light in my eyes, and the interest in the customer? Let's do another one: \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME]. And yours?\u201d [pause] \u201cBefore we get started, Elaine, I'd like to tell you that my job here is to give you all the time and all the information you need, so when you do get around to making a decision, I'm confident you'll consider us.\u201d Here's another for you: \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME]. And yours?\u201d [pause] \u201cGreg, if I could just take a moment to tell you our philosophy here. First, if we don't have the right product for you and are not able for some reason, to make the money agreeable, we don't expect you to do business here. Is that fair enough?\" Finally, here's one more: \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME]. And yours?\u201d [pause] \u201cKelly, my job is to find you what you want that fits your needs exactly, and provide you with figures you can agree to in the shortest period of time possible. That's my focus and that's my job. Is that agreeable to you?\" These greetings are proven ways for you to gain control and separate yourself from the competition. They're quick. They're fast. They're friendly. They reduce confrontation. And the buyer will turn control over to you so that you can keep moving them toward the close. 8. \u201cObjections\u201d in Step 1 Now, in this final segment about Step 1: Greet, we're going to handle, and I quote, the \u201cobjections\u201d [FACILITATOR: Make air quotes with your hands as you say this] you'll experience in this step. I'm calling them \u201cobjections\u201d because that's what many other sales trainers and salespeople call them. However, I want you to understand this: They're not really objections. They're RDRs, Reactionary Defense Responses. They're automatic things that people say without even knowing. As we discussed before the break, RDRs are designed to protect your customer and put you off. Most of the time, because salespeople are not trained well enough, they work. Many salespeople take them personally and give them far too much significance, even going as far as calling them objections. I'm talking about things like: \u201cHey, I'm just looking.\u201d \u201cI only have ten minutes.\u201d \u201cI'm looking for someone else.\u201d \u201cLet me see your manager.\u201d \u201cWe're not buying for three months.\u201d \u201cWe're going to wait for an insurance check.\u201d There are three keys to handling these: 1. Handle them not like objections but as Reactionary Defense Responses. 2. Know that every one of these things, every one, that whole list that I just gave you, suggests that you have a real opportunity in front of you- a client, a customer. 3. Never let these things affect your attitude, and always agree to what the customer says or asks for. \u201cI'm waiting three months.\u201d Your response? \u201cExcellent.\u201d It's better to surrender here and close later than to fight people and never be able to close a deal. In these next 15 minutes, I'm going to help you prepare for these, so you don't get caught off guard. As you continue to work your position, you may want to keep a log of the RDRs you hear in Step 1. You might think it's going to be infinite, but you'll come to realize that there are probably no more than 15 or so RDRs you'll hear in this step. List them so you're prepared to handle every one of them that you hear. I'm going to show you exactly how to handle the most common RDRs you'll encounter. As we go through them, you're going to notice a theme: Many times, your buyer will ask for one thing, but they actually want something completely different. It's kind of like when a friend asks you for advice. Let's be honest: Most of the time, they don't really want it. So in this segment, we're going to talk about understanding how to determine the difference between 1) what people ask of you and 2) what they really want. This will be vital to your success as a salesperson. 9."

    "subsection_topic": "Initiate and Disarm Your Buyer",
    "text": "Initiate and Disarm Your Buyer We'll start with our favorite way at Cardone Enterprises to handle an objection or an RDR. This strategy is a little \u201cout there,\u201d but it works in person, on the phone, or even in an email: Initiate the objection or RDR before your buyer can bring it up. Now, remember that list I just mentioned? Here's where it comes in handy. In order to initiate, you have to know every possible objection or RDR you might hear. That way, you can initiate them, take the sting out, control the process, and differentiate yourself from everyone else in your market immediately. Because, after all, why would you wait? If you know that your buyer is going to have a question or initiate some objection, why would you wait for them to bring it up? Why not just bring it up and disarm them? Maybe it's price, maybe it's payments, maybe it's about what you have in stock vs. what you have to special order, or maybe it's about how long the process will take. But before we get there, you need to anticipate what you, in your specific business and role, are going to hear. And instead of crossing your fingers and hoping they don't bring it up, get on the offensive, and address it. Bring it up yourself and you'll have immediate control of the process. Here's how it works: \u201cWelcome. My name is [FACILITATOR NAME]. And yours? My job here is...\u201d And initiate right here: \u201c...to get you the product you want in the shortest time possible\u201d or \u201c...to get you the best price and terms, and anything else you need in the shortest period of time possible. Is that fair enough?\" Already with that opening, I'm initiating whatever my customers are most sensitive to-time, price, how long it's going to take-and this moves us further into the process. You have to assure people, guarantee them you're not going to waste their time, and immediately remove any confrontation from your process. The reality is that if you bring up buyer-sensitive issues before they're able to, you're going to force yourself to learn how to handle them. You're not going to be cringing inside, waiting for your buyer to bring them up. You're going to learn how to handle them with confidence so you can keep control of the sale. Be a pro here. Initiate sensitive issues, and I promise you, you will immediately differentiate yourself from everybody in the market. Now, let's talk about the three RDRs you're likely to encounter in Step 1, ones you'll want to get in front of. The first one, of course, is price. 10. \u201cWhat's Your Best Price?\u201d We're starting here because all of our students ask this question: \u201cHow do I handle price when a buyer brings it up early-before I want to talk about it?\u201d We're going to talk about price a lot today, and it's such a misunderstood issue. However, the first thing you need to know is that if you're asking that question, you're focusing on the wrong thing. Let me explain. You've probably been told things in the past like, \u201cDon't talk price. Don't give a price. Avoid price. Get control. Don't give it prematurely;\u201d if you actually do any of those things, you're going to turn your buyer off. You'll also probably look like you have something to hide-and maybe even like you don't know what you're doing. None of these will reflect well on you or your company. And, in fact, it will likely create the exact reaction that you don't want. The bottom line is this: The more you hide from price, the more your buyer will want to hunt you down to get it from you. When a customer wants to talk about price, your best attitude is one of agreement. It's basically the first rule of selling, no matter whether you sell a $1 product or a $10 million one. When your buyer asks about price in Step 1, your response could be, \u201cNo problem. I'd be happy to get that for you. I know it's important, and I assure you, we will get you the best price.\u201d Or you could say, \u201cI'd be happy to get you our best price,\u201d or \u201cIf the price isn't agreeable, look, I wouldn't expect you to do business with me.\u201d Or here's the supercharged version: \u201cNot only will I get you the price, but I'd also like to get you the terms, show you the most effective way to XYZ, and share some other options that you may not have considered yet.\u201d What does every one of these say? That I'm confident. Here's the real trick: Every one of those statements has to be followed immediately by a question. Why? So that you can get off that topic and transition to another one. So although pretty much everyone we've ever taught at Cardone Enterprises asks us, \u201cHow do I handle price prematurely?\u201d, there's another question they should be asking: \u201cWhat's the transition question I need to ask right now to get off price and get to the next step of the Perfect Sales Process?\u201d Do you understand what I'm saying here? Instead of asking us how to handle price prematurely, you should be focused on what question to ask so you can transition out of the price discussion. There's a vital rule governing the sales process: He or she who asks the questions and gets answers controls the process. Let me repeat that: He or she who asks the questions and gets answers controls the process. If the buyer says, \u201cHey, I want your best price,\u201d and you give it to him here in Step 1, you're not in control. They are. So, instead, when you hear \u201c[STUDENT NAME], I need your best price,\u201d you say: \u201cSure, I'd be happy to get you the best price. I'd also like to get you payments, terms, and share some other options that might be possible for you. And by the way, I'd like to do it in the shortest period of time possible. Does that work for you?\u201d Get agreement and then ask that transition question: \u201cExactly how did you want me to outfit it?\u201d Or: \u201cI'd be happy to. In addition to price, can I also show you alternatives that maybe you and the company haven't even considered?\u201d What's the formula here? Agree, assure, and transition. Agree, assure, and transition. That transition question is going to move you right into the next step of the Perfect Sales Process: Determine Wants and Needs. That's where you need to be. And one final note: Never be scared of price. Be scared when they don't want a price. People that ask about price are buyers. People that never ask aren't buyers. So when you get the price question in Step 1, handle it: Agree, assure, and transition. Now, let's talk about the next RDR you'll hear a lot: \u201cI'm just looking.\u201d 11. \u201cI'm Just Looking\u201d If you've been in sales for any length of time, I know you've heard this one: Now this phrase, \u201cI'm just looking,\u201d suggests what? In my opinion, opportunity. \u201cHey, I'm just looking for some insurance. I'm just looking for a mortgage. I'm looking for some jewelry. I'm looking for whatever.\u201d Think about it: Who doesn't look before they decide they want something? What does it mean? Usually that you've got a buyer who has some money to spend. They're looking because they're interested. Now, maybe they're not interested in your product, maybe they're not buying today, but they're interested in something. Salespeople hear \u201cI'm just looking\u201d so often, and because they don't know how to handle it-or their own attitudes about it-they become sold on the idea that people are just killing time. Look, nobody's got time to kill. People who kill time go lay on the sofa and watch Netflix. Never forget this: Under the right conditions, under the right situation, when sold the right product, \u201cjust looking\u201d becomes \u201cjust sold.\u201d But you have to know how to handle it, so let's run through this scenario. 1. Get your attitude right. If you don't have a positive attitude, you're never going to get past \u201cI'm just looking.\u201d That's why we went over your attitude first, before we even started talking through the Perfect Sales Process. 2. Know that \u201cjust looking\u201d means they want to do something. What it is exactly may not be clear-not to you and not to them. \u201cJust looking\u201d for a watch might mean a ring for their partner. It means they want to at least move in the direction of buying something that you sell. It's up to you to help them get there, and that's what the Perfect Sales Process is all about. 3. When you hear \u201cjust looking,\u201d realize what it actually means is \u201cI need information.\u201d And what's the next logical step here? They're looking for someone to give them that information-that's you. So show them what they need, and help them make sense of it all. Now that you understand what's really going on when someone says, \u201cI'm just looking,\u201d what kind of language should you use to handle it? \u201cGreat. I'd be happy to point you in the right direction. Are you looking for something bigger or smaller than what you have now?\u201d You can adapt this to fit just about any industry: \u201cAre you looking for more insurance than you have now or less?\u201d Or: \u201cSomething that will provide you with more or less protection for the same or less money?\u201d Or even more positively: \u201cGreat. You'll be happy to know we have an excellent selection of those to look at. Are you considering yellow or white gold?\u201d Now, what do these questions remind you of? They're transitions, right? Just like we discussed in the last section on handling price. All of these questions transition you into the next phase of the Perfect Sales Process: Determine Wants and Needs. They keep the sale moving forward. Just like with the price questions, you're going to follow the same formula: Agree, assure, and transition. Here's another response to \u201cI'm just looking:\u201d \u201cGreat to have you here. Take as much time as you need to look. Can I at least point you in the right direction?\u201d This works in any type of selling, particularly retail, and your buyer is going to tell you what he or she is looking for, which transitions you into the next step and keeps the sale moving forward. Don't be put off by \u201cI'm just looking.\u201d Remember what I said earlier. Under the right conditions, under the right situation, when sold the right product, \u201cjust looking\u201d becomes \u201cjust sold.\u201d Now, let's talk about the third common objection or RDR you might hear in this first step of the Perfect Sales Process. 12. \u201c"

    "subsection_topic": "What's Your Best Price?",
    "text": "We’re starting here because all of our students ask this question: “How do I handle price when a buyer brings it up early—before I want to talk about it?” We’re going to talk about price a lot today, and it’s such a misunderstood issue. However, the first thing you need to know is that if you’re asking that question, you’re focusing on the wrong thing. Let me explain. You’ve probably been told things in the past like, “Don’t talk price. Don’t give a price. Avoid price. Get control. Don’t give it prematurely;” if you actually do any of those things, you’re going to turn your buyer off. You’ll also probably look like you have something to hide—and maybe even like you don’t know what you’re doing. None of these will reflect well on you or your company. And, in fact, it will likely create the exact reaction that you don’t want. The bottom line is this: The more you hide from price, the more your buyer will want to hunt you down to get it from you. When a customer wants to talk about price, your best attitude is one of agreement. It’s basically the first rule of selling, no matter whether you sell a $1 product or a $10 million one. When your buyer asks about price in Step 1, your response could be, “No problem. I’d be happy to get that for you. I know it’s important, and I assure you, we will get you the best price.” Or you could say, “I’d be happy to get you our best price,” or “If the price isn’t agreeable, look, I wouldn’t expect you to do business with me.” Or here’s the supercharged version: “Not only will I get you the price, but I’d also like to get you the terms, show you the most effective way to XYZ, and share some other options that you may not have considered yet.” What does every one of these say? That I’m confident. Here’s the real trick: Every one of those statements has to be followed immediately by a question. Why? So that you can get off that topic and transition to another one. So although pretty much everyone we’ve ever taught at Cardone Enterprises asks us, “How do I handle price prematurely?”, there’s another question they should be asking: “What’s the transition question I need to ask right now to get off price and get to the next step of the Perfect Sales Process?” Do you understand what I’m saying here? Instead of asking us how to handle price prematurely, you should be focused on what question to ask so you can transition out of the price discussion. There’s a vital rule governing the sales process: He or she who asks the questions and gets answers controls the process. Let me repeat that: He or she who asks the questions and gets answers controls the process. If the buyer says, “Hey, I want your best price,” and you give it to him here in Step 1, you’re not in control. They are. So, instead, when you hear “[STUDENT NAME], I need your best price,” you say: “Sure, I’d be happy to get you the best price. I’d also like to get you payments, terms, and share some other options that might be possible for you. And by the way, I’d like to do it in the shortest period of time possible. Does that work for you?” Get agreement and then ask that transition question: “Exactly how did you want me to outfit it?” Or: “I’d be happy to. In addition to price, can I also show you alternatives that maybe you and the company haven’t even considered?” What’s the formula here? Agree, assure, and transition. Agree, assure, and transition. That transition question is going to move you right into the next step of the Perfect Sales Process: Determine Wants and Needs. That’s where you need to be. And one final note: Never be scared of price. Be scared when they don’t want a price. People that ask about price are buyers. People that never ask aren’t buyers. So when you get the price question in Step 1, handle it: Agree, assure, and transition. Now, let’s talk about the next RDR you’ll hear a lot: “I’m just looking.”"

Or \u201cthe owner,\u201d \u201cthe president,\u201d or someone else high up? This makes some people nervous. However, I want to shift your mindset around this request. What if you approached this as an opportunity? What if you had the confidence that you knew everything you needed to turn any situation-vendor, complaint, problem-into a closed deal? What if you had the mindset that said: \u201cGive me any living human being to convert into a sold customer, and I'll create my own economy\u201d? What could you achieve? Think about that. Now, when someone comes in looking for the manager, you have one of three things: 1) a vendor trying to sell management on what they have, 2) a complaint, or 3) a buyer. If you have the kind of unstoppable mindset that believes you can sell anyone, those first two can also be made into clients: the complaint and the vendor. Grant loves to tell the story of an advertising exec who walked into a retail environment, looking to talk to the owner so he could sell him an advertising package. Grant sold him a house full of furniture before turning him over to the manager. With the right mindset and the right system, you can do the same thing. Now, how about the complaint? It might not seem like it at first, but they're even easier to turn into customers. How? By solving their problems quickly and easily-and just as effectively as a manager would. You just need to figure out what the problem is and solve it right there on the spot, if you can. Then the person doesn't have to wait around for a manager. Now, sometimes a buyer walks in asking for a manager because they think it will save them time-and maybe get them a better deal. This can be an opportunity, if you handle it. Because let me be clear: All of these scenarios are opportunities. Don't let them pass you by. Go into every interaction and every opportunity with the intent to sell. If you don't have the intent to close and finish, you won't. Right conditions, right situation, right product: Anyone can be converted. Let's talk about a couple of ways to handle this request: \u201cI want to speak to the manager:\u201d You say: \u201cYour name, sir? Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones, thank you for coming in today. I handle all the accounts for management here. My position was created to save you time, determine what you want, and introduce you to alternatives that will save you money. My job is to treat you the way the owner would if he were able to wait on you himself. Will you allow me to do that for you?\u201d Or, a simpler way to handle it: \u201cI'm part of the management team here, sir. Your name?\u201d Problems are opportunities, remember that. Convert problems, solve them- opportunity. Your management team hired you to handle customers, not turn them back over to management. Stay with this customer, be a service to this customer. They're not asking for a manager because they don't want something. They're asking for a manager because they do want something. Be professional. Act like you know what you're doing, act like a manager, act like part of the team, act like you can handle the problem, and, I promise you, with everything you'll learn today, you'll make the sale. Now, before we take a break, I'm going to take you through the next step in the Perfect Sales Process: Step 2: Determine Wants and Needs.

    "subsection_topic": "The Importance of Determining Wants and Needs",
    "text": "The Importance of Determining Wants and Needs In this final session before our lunch break, we'll move into Step 2 of the Perfect Sales Process: Determine Wants and Needs. In this step, you'll discover what your buyer wants, what they need, and why. The fastest way to do this is a process called \u201cfact finding.\u201d You might also have heard it referred to as \u201cqualifying,\u201d \u201cidentifying wants and needs,\u201d or even \u201cinvestigation.\u201d Whatever you call it, this step is all about getting quality questions answered. The ultimate purpose of this step is twofold: (1) to know what product to show your client and (2) to know how to present the product in a manner that will build value in that presentation, and cause them to want to act. When you ask the right questions, they clarify for you and your buyer what they want, why they want it, how they can justify actually buying it, and how you can make sense of them making that decision to buy. As we go through this step, keep in mind that even things of equal value are not identical when the motivation for that thing changes. A glass of water, for example, is the same as any other glass of water, right? That's true until you discover the reason why someone might want the glass of water. You'll uncover these in Step 2. For example, a glass of water for the Thanksgiving dinner table has a different connotation than a glass of water that would be used to wash poison out of someone's eye or one used to satisfy the thirst of someone who's dehydrated. You'd approach the selection and presentation differently for all these three scenarios, right? You would-if you wanted to make the sale. Remember all purchases or investments are trying to solve a problem of some sort. All of them. In this step, it's your job to understand your buyer's specific problem- the wants and needs driving the purchase. In order to do so, you'll be seeking out information such as: Why that product? Why did they decide to come in today? Why now? What's the motive? During Step 2, you might find yourself asking questions like: \u201cWhat do you like about what you have now?\u201d or \u201cWhat would you change about what you have now?\u201d or \u201cWhat are you trying to accomplish by buying this product?\u201d Ultimately, if you don't find out what is driving or motivating your customer, you won't know the right product for that person. You won't know how to present it correctly and you won't close the deal. We call this the Dominant Buying Motive-the DBM. In other words, what's that one thing that would push somebody over the edge and buy? Your challenge is to get away with asking the right questions and getting the answers, so you can collect the information you need to control the sale-and close the deal. 2."

    "text": "Overcoming the Challenges of 21st Century Fact Finding Why did I frame asking these quality questions and getting the answers you need as a \u201cchallenge?\u201d Your customers are guarded, for all the reasons we discussed this morning. They're trained not to give much. Maybe they even have bad perceptions of salespeople-because they've possibly been manipulated in the past-and they'll resist answering your questions. That's why your attitude is so critical. You need to present an attitude of service, not control; of helping people, not manipulation. Only then you will get your questions answered. Finally, it all comes back to something we've talked about earlier: putting your buyer at ease so they will answer questions. That's why the first step of the Perfect Sales Process-Greet-is such a critical foundation for the rest of these steps. Follow the system, and you're going to show up differently than your competitors. Because ultimately, you care more than anyone else and you need to present yourself that way. That's why you're asking these questions. Because you're more willing, more helpful, and you'll give more of yourself. That entitles you to ask more of your buyers. Lastly, one more thing to keep in mind: Practice the questions you'll use in this step until you feel natural. This is critical because you don't want to waste your attention on your questions. You want your attention on what? The answers. You need the quality information the buyer's answers will offer you. Now let's take a closer look at your goal in this step-the what, the why, and the how- as well as how those three things are going to help you close more deals. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "The Goals of Step 2: The What, the Why, and the How",
    "text": "The Goals of Step 2: The What, the Why, and the How Why do people buy things? Ultimately, it all comes down to two reasons: 1) to solve a problem or 2) because they fall in love. People do crazy stuff to solve problems, and people do even crazier stuff when they're in love. Our goal is to find out what problem your customer's trying to solve and what they consider something they love. When it comes to Step 2: Determine Wants and Needs, we break it down into three areas we're looking to understand: 1) the what, 2) the why, and 3) the how. What do you want? Why do you want it? And how do you want it? In other words, what's the right product for this customer? Why do they need it? And how should you present that product and present the offer to close the deal? If you lack any one of these pieces of information, your customer simply won't buy. If you don't know what and why, you won't know how. So memorize these three things: the what, the why, and the how, because they're your key to closing the deal. Here's an example. Let's say you're selling phones. A woman walks into your store and says, \u201cI want a new telephone. This is the phone I want.\u201d Now if you really want to sell her a phone, here's the question you need to ask: \u201cWhat's important to you in your next phone?\u201d Why would you ask that question? She said she just wanted this phone. But you don't know what to show her. Are you going to show her how easy it is to unlock the phone, how to use Siri to dial hands-free, or how much capacity this new model has to hold apps and photos? You wouldn't know. She just asked for a phone. But what if she says: \u201cVideo is most important to me.\u201d Now you have some direction. So you might say, \u201cLet me ask you, why is video so important to you?\u201d She might say: \u201cBecause I want to make videos for social media that I want to drop on YouTube. I also just had a baby and I want to send videos of her to my parents.\u201d Now you know all the elements. You've got the what, you've got the why, and you know how to present that phone to her so she buys on the spot: It's all about those videos for her. Here's another example. Let's say you're a real estate agent. Your buyer comes to you and says, \u201cI'm looking for a new house. I see you have that one for sale in Malibu. I'm interested in taking a tour.\u201d You might say: \u201cExcellent. Let me ask you, what's most important to you when you're considering a home? What is it about the location? Why is that important?\u201d And he might say something like, \u201cMy wife is pregnant with our second child, and our current home is too far away from the school system we want our kids to go to.\u201d You thought he was buying a house, just like you thought the previous woman was buying a phone. She was buying a video camera that uploads to YouTube, and he's buying access to a new zip code and the school system. All it takes is just a few simple, relevant questions so you know the three things-the what, the why, and the how to present it, so you can close those deals on autopilot. Let's do one more here, and I'm going to take you a little more in depth, so you can see how to use relevant questions to get the information you need. Let's talk about Thanksgiving. Have you ever found yourself in the grocery store, staring at the 16-pound, 20-pound turkeys, trying to remember what the formula is for how many pounds you need to buy for each person? If ever there were a scenario that needs the help of a caring salesperson more, I can't think of one. So let's say that we fly in a Cardone-trained salesperson to assist. That's me. So I arrive and I see a woman staring at the turkeys with a blank look on her face. I say: \u201cWelcome, my name's [FACILITATOR NAME]. Are you getting ready for Thanksgiving? What information can I get you?\u201d She says: \u201cI'm looking for a turkey.\" I say: \"Excellent. How many people will you be feeding?\u201d She says: \"Twelve people.\" \"Great. Are they all going to be eating turkey?\" \"No, three of them are vegans.\" \u201cExcellent, now what would you like to serve them?\u201d She tells you. You continue: \u201cGreat. What have you already purchased for that dinner?\u201d She tells you. I say: \u201cExcellent. Let me ask you this, Last year what did you do?\u201d \u201cLast year we did pork.\u201d \u201cHave you picked out your pork yet?\u201d \"No, we haven't done that.\" \u201cGood. So you're going to need turkey, and you're going to need pork roast. What about sides? Have you considered sides? What about desserts?\u201d What do you notice here? See, I'm not going to sell her one turkey. I'm going to sell a turkey, a pork roast, something for the vegans. I'm going to get her four sides. I'm going to get her four desserts. I'm probably even going to get the alcohol handled for her. I'll be in business forever. I'm creating my own economy by taking the time to take interest in this woman. I'm not trying to control or manipulate her with questions. I'm trying to find out the what, the why, and the how. She came in looking for a turkey, right? Or rather, she said she was looking for a turkey. But she's not looking for a turkey. She's here to solve a problem. She's in this store to buy dinner to take care of her friends, her neighbors, her family, or whoever is going to her Thanksgiving dinner. Look, if you don't sell her a turkey, a pork roast, something for the vegans, the side dishes and desserts, then you're the turkey. And by taking the time to ask smart questions, you're going to be able to get the customer to give you control. You're showing interest, and you're going to speed up your process. You're actually able to speed up her process as well by clarifying the difference between what she wants and what she needs that she can be closed on. To be clear: Your goal is not to change the customer's mind about what they're buying. Your job is to find the right product or solution that will satisfy their needs. The most important person in the sales cycle is not you. It's the customer. The more you ask questions, good questions, the more important the customer is going to feel. So let's talk about four great questions that will help you figure out what people want, why they want it, and how to present it so you close them. These questions will also reveal some additional information: what they're willing to give up and what they're not willing to give up. Question #1: What would you like to have if you could afford it? Question #2: What do you need to have that you're not willing to give up? Question #3: What do you have now that you'd like to have next time? Or: What have you done before that you'd like to repeat? Question #4: What would you like to have next time that you don't have now? Make these questions a part of who you are, so you can do a better job of finding out what people want, why they need it and how to close them. Now let's talk about another method that can give you some clues as to how your buyer will respond during the sales process. 4."

    "subsection_topic": "Uncovering Clues from Past Purchases",
    "text": "Uncovering Clues from Past Purchases Detectives inspect the scene of the crime to find the clues they need to solve that crime. In sales, we do something similar, but what we're doing is going back to the last thing your buyer bought that's similar. That purchase leaves clues. I don't care what you sell. Go back to a similar purchase, something they can relate to, one that they'll talk about, and it will show you what your buyer will do in the future-and, more specifically, how they'll respond during the sale you're trying to close. To return to the example of selling phones, you might ask questions like: Tell me about the last phone you bought. Who'd you buy it from? What plan did you buy? What did you like about that phone? What didn't you like about that phone? What would you change about the phone? If your new phone could do one thing that your old phone couldn't do, what would it be? Your buyer might tell you, \u201cI hated my last phone because it took terrible pictures.\u201d She's telling you exactly how to sell her a phone. Even when they're not getting rid of the old product, this still works. For example, if someone were buying a vacation home from me, I'd want to know about where they're living now. Why? So I can understand how to build value. So I can discover what they think is important in a home. You're controlling the sale with questions like, \u201cLet me ask you, what do you want your new purchase to do that your other one didn't accomplish for you?\u201d or \u201cIf the next could only do one thing or solve one problem, what would that be?\u201d Go back to the scene of the last crime. And remember, what I said earlier: Always get an answer to your question. Don't move on to another question without an answer. That way, you keep control of the sale and keep collecting information that's going to help you close. 5."

I'm going to lay these out for you, and I never want to hear you ask any of these: What can you put down? What can you pay? What do you owe? What is your budget? Will you buy today? How's your credit? Where do you work? How long have you been there? What do you make on your job? Is your spouse going to be involved in the decision? Do you rent or own your home? Are you shopping anywhere else? What price did they give you? Now, what's the big problem with all of these questions? First, they're not going to put your buyer at ease. They're too personal-and they're negative. Instead of putting the buyer at ease, you're going to put them on alert. Additionally, when you ask questions like this too early in the sales process, you also run the risk of your buyer locking in on a figure that's too low. They're not sold on the fact that the product will solve their problems, and they haven't discovered that they love it. As a result, your buyer's going to minimize any figures they're going to pay, because they don't like you yet. There's no relationship there. As a result, you're going to get some really unrealistic answers that won't be useful to you. Your customer will become inflexible because they're going to lock down on a price that's not realistic. It's going to make your close very difficult. So stay away from these questions. They don't get you smart answers. They don't move the sale forward, and, worst of all, they make you sound like everybody else. 6."

In just a moment, we're going to take a few minutes and customize these to what you do. Then when you go home, you need to sit down and memorize these so you know them backward and forward. Why? So you're fluid, not mechanical. Then you can focus on the answer, which is going to give you the critical information you need to make the sale. First, let's go through some questions about their current and future situations-in other words, what they're looking for: \u201cDo you want to go bigger or smaller than what you have now?\u201d When you customize this phrase for your product, the question might become \u201clonger or shorter\u201d or \u201cheavier or lighter.\u201d Find the features that differentiate your products and use them here. \u201cWho will be the primary user? Who will be the secondary user? Will that person be involved in the selection?\u201d \u201cHow do you want it to come equipped?\u201d \u201cWhat options would you like to have, if affordable?\u201d \u201cWhat do you want on your new one that your present situation doesn't have?\u201d \u201cWhat do you want the new one to do for you that your present one doesn't do for you?\u201d \u201cWhat major benefit do you hope to get from your new product?\u201d \u201cWhat else do you hope to get?\u201d \u201cOh, by the way, why do you have an interest in this? Why is this product important to you?\u201d \u201cWhy are you considering it at this time?\u201d or \u201cWhy now?\u201d \u201cWhy did you call today?\u201d or \u201cWhy'd you come in today?\u201d \u201cHave you ever owned something like this before?\u201d \u201cWhat is the single most important thing that you want from your next purchase and why?\u201d \u201cWhat's the second most important consideration of this purchase and why?\u201d Next, I'm going to run you through a list that's going to help you even more than the previous list-one with questions about their previous purchases: \u201cWhat are you using now to solve this same problem?\u201d \u201cWhat do you like about what you're using now to solve this problem?\u201d \u201cWhat don't you like about it?\u201d \u201cWhen's your next payment due?\u201d Even if they tell you they paid cash for it, that still helps you. It leaves clues about how you can help them later. \u201cDid you buy it new or used or did you buy it as a floor model?\u201d That's good info to know. \u201cHow long have you had it?\u201d \u201cWhat was the list price back when you bought it?\u201d That's going to help you justifyyour price. \u201cLet me ask you, would you purchase that product again?\u201d If yes, \u201cWhy?\u201d or if no, \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cWhat do you like most about that product? What did you like least about that product?\u201d \u201cDo you feel your present situation has been worth what you paid for it? Do youthink it was a good deal?\u201d Would they repeat it? That's what you're trying to find out. \u201cHave you made any changes to it since you purchased?\u201d See what I'm doing here? I'm using their current situation to collect information on how to close on the next situation. The first list of questions helps you understand what they want. Then, this second list, by discovering what they've had and what kind of experience they've gone through, will show you how to close them. Customize these lists for your particular situation, put both of them together, and know them cold. Do those things, and I know you'll close more deals.

    "text": "The Keys to Step 3 of the Perfect Sales Process Welcome back! Before lunch, we covered the first two steps of the Perfect Sales Process in detail: Step One: Greet, in which you discovered how to introduce yourself, make a good impression, and put the buyer at ease, and Step Two: Determine Wants and Needs, in which you investigated not only what the buyer wants and needs, but also why they want it. Now, we're going to move into the next phase: Step 3: Select Product and Present/ Build Value. Step 3 of the Perfect Sales Process centers around three things: 1) knowing what product to show your client and then 2) demonstrating that product in a manner that builds emotional urgency to own it, and then, finally, 3) putting together a presentation that demonstrates value that exceeds the value of their money. In this first section, I'll cover that first point. Then, we'll take a quick break and do a deep dive on putting together a great presentation. This step hinges on these principles: You cannot close if your product doesn't exceed the value that your buyer puts on it. You also can't close if you show your buyers the wrong product. If it doesn't fully satisfy their wants and needs, they will not buy it at any price. If it's outside their ability to pay for it, they will also not buy it. Would you agree? [FACILITATOR: Get assent before moving on.] If the product doesn't solve problems, they're not going to buy. If they don't have complete confidence in the product or if they don't love it, they're simply not going to buy. I'm going to show you how to overcome all of these challenges in this step. First, we're going to talk about how to select the right product. Then, I'll show you how to demonstrate it in a professional manner whereby quickly you can validate that the product solves their problems, fulfills their wants and needs, creates urgency, engenders love in their heart, and leaves them with the feeling of: \u201cI've got to absolutely have this!\u201d And here's a distinction I want you to understand in this step: Select for your client rather than allowing them to wander through your inventory and select for themselves. Whether your product is tangible or not doesn't matter. If you're selling insurance, based on what you found out in the first two steps, you should now be able to select and present a solution, while explaining how it will benefit your client. The same holds true with any other presentation, whether it be a piece of art, a car, furniture, a membership at the country club, a gift for a charity event-or even a simple glass of water. You should present your product based on what your client told you was important to them. If you've got a man choking in front of you, he doesn't care about the quality of the crystal or the quality of the water. If you haven't taken the time to find out in Step 2 what's important to your buyer, you'll waste time in your presentation showing them things that just don't matter. That's why it's so important to do every step of the Perfect Sales Process-in order. Shortcut the demonstration and you only reduce your chances of making a sale. Spend too much time during the demonstration on things that the buyer doesn't find valuable, and you not only waste time but also reduce your chances of making a sale. By the way, we used to teach these two steps separately, as the selection and the demonstration. However, they're so interrelated that we're going to discuss them together. Selecting the right product and knowing how to present it will determine whether you're able to close the deal, and both will also have a direct impact on how successful you are as a salesperson. Let's dive into the first part of Step 3, the selection. 2."

    "subsection_topic": "Selecting the Right Product",
    "text": "Selecting the Right Product Now as we move into the first part of this step, the selection, there's one fact I want you to know: Understand that if your buyer already knew what they wanted for sure, they would have already bought it. I'm going to repeat that, and you should take it as a rule. No matter how crystal clear your client may appear regarding what they want, know this: If they were certain, they'd already own it. So any time a buyer is shopping with me for anything, I know that they're not sure about something. Assumptions are rarely safe, but this one is: I assume in every selling situation that the person you're working with is only closed on what he or she wants, and never, never completely clear on why he or she wants it. Understood? Another fact that I've discovered from personal experience: Around 50% of the time, your buyer will be interested in a product that will not fulfill his or her wants and needs. Think about that. Now do you understand why you can't skip the selection? Why you can't let them select the product themselves? Why talking about price right off the bat is a bad idea? Because your buyer isn't even on the right product over 50% of the time. And what does that really mean? It could mean too much product. It could mean too little product. Or, it could mean just not the right product at the time. What happens as a result of all of this? They don't close, right?, Why? Because they're not fully clear on why they want it almost 100% of the time. And if they aren't clear on why they want a product, they will not close on it. And 50% of the time, it's not the right product anyway. That's why determining wants and needs-fact finding-is so important. In that step, we verified what problem they're trying to solve. We asked things like, \u201cWhat do you want this to do that others don't do for you?\u201d and \u201cWhy did you come in at this time?\u201d That's why those of us at Cardone Enterprises answer our phones with: \u201cHi, this is [FACILITATOR NAME]. What problem can I help you solve?\u201d Because everyone that calls is calling to solve a problem. Maybe they want to make more money. Maybe they want to close more. Maybe they want to do it all faster, quicker, better. Everyone's got problems. So what problems are your buyers trying to solve? Pay attention. Remember what your buyer told you. Collect that information so you can use it to select the right product and build value around it. Just remember: Your buyers don't have complete certainty or they would have bought already. You should already know the problems they're trying to solve, so you can put them on the right product. Add that extra ingredient-certainty-and you'll be that much closer to closing the deal. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "Verifying Selection with Alternatives",
    "text": "Verifying Selection with Alternatives Now, how do we get absolutely certain that we're offering our buyer the right product? It all comes down to one of the great secrets of selling: offering your buyers alternatives. There are all kinds of benefits to doing this. And let me be clear: I offer my buyers an alternative in every selling situation before I guide them toward what they stated they want. Here's how that might look. As I'm moving the client towards the target product-the one they're interested in-I ask this question: \u201cIs there any chance you'd consider moving up a model, if it were affordable?\u201d Your buyer might say something like, \"Well, what do you mean?\" And you'd say, \u201cWell, would you move up to the sport model?\u201d (Or a different package, whatever represents a step up in your world.) \u201cIt's only going to be a little more money. And with the payment programs we have right now and the interest rates so low, the payments are going to be well within-\u201d Maybe they break in and say: \u201cNo, no, no. I definitely want this vehicle. I've done all my research. This is the one I want.\u201d Or: \u201cThis is the phone I want.\u201d Or: \u201cThis is the policy I want.\u201d Or: \u201cThis is the house I want.\u201d So what did I just accomplish? I got some more information, didn't I? And I increased the buyer's certainty. By the way, alternatives aren't exclusively about moving up. They're also about moving down. To offer a lower-priced alternative, you could say something like: \u201cWould you consider moving down a model? Save you two, maybe three thousand dollars?\u201d Now, why would I do this? Why would I check out a lower-priced alternative with somebody, especially somebody who walked in and gave me a sheet of paper and said, \u201cThis is exactly what I want\u201d? Let's play this scenario out. First, the buyer tells me what they want. I'm going to say, \u201cNo problem, let's go find it.\u201d Then as I'm walking toward it, I'd turn back and say, \u201cHey, any chance you'd consider moving down a package, save you about two or three thousand?\u201d What does this do? The same two things as offering a higher-priced alternative: 1. It validates and confirms that you're on the correct product choice. Remember, if your buyer knew for sure, they what? They wouldn't be shopping. They'd already be driving it. 2. It demonstrates to your buyer that you want the right thing for them, from your heart. Why would you offer to save somebody money? Why would you offer to put them in something better-equipped if it could be close to what they're spending now? Why would you do that? Because you're looking out for them. By offering choices, you actually show people that you care, that it matters to you that they're on the right product and they get the most value for their money. Here's another example from another industry. Let's say you have a buyer who asks about a home in Bel-Air. You could say, \u201cWould you consider moving to another neighborhood rather than Bel-Air? Save you anywhere from 800k to a million dollars?\u201d If they say, \u201cNo, we don't want that. We only want to live in Bel-Air.\u201d What did you just find out? They're locked in to Bel-Air, and you probably helped them clarify that. Now, if they say, \u201cYes, we would look at other neighborhoods.\u201d Or, \u201cWell, we might.\u201d What'd you find out? They're not locked in to Bel-Air. They don't know what they want yet. They might be looking in the wrong area completely and they need you even more to help them with the selection. Now, one last point about alternative offers. I get some salespeople who come to me and say that their buyer got upset about being offered alternatives. Maybe they heard their buyer say something like, \u201cWhy do you keep trying to show me something else? This is the one I want.\u201d That's not a customer who's upset. That's a customer who's clear. And maybe you even helped him get there. Don't take it as anything other than that. Your response? \u201cNo problem, sir. I'll take you right to the one you want. I just wanted to show you that we have other options for you in the case that you wanted to investigate them.\u201d Look, most salespeople aren't salespeople. They're order takers who wander around wondering, \u201cWhy don't I sell more?\u201d It's because they don't actually sell. They just take orders. Understand this: People cannot and will not make decisions without knowing what the choices are. Choices do not confuse people. Choices actually allow the mind evidence that it has considered enough options. When people go to buy, their mind is telling them things like: \u201cThis is the first place we've looked. You haven't looked at enough stuff. You'd better not do it yet. Don't make any rash decisions.\u201d But then you come in and say, \u201cSir, would you consider something smaller?\u201d His mind says, \u201cNo. Okay, we checked that off.\u201d You say, \u201cSir, would you consider something bigger?\u201d His mind says, \u201cNo. We checked that off. Okay. We know what we want.\u201d His mind's clear. Then he can make a decision. Always offer alternatives before you select. This is one of these distinctions to selling that will catapult you to another arena. Now, let's get a little more tactical here and break down the mechanics of alternatives. 4."

    "subsection_topic": "The Mechanics of Offering Alternatives",
    "text": "The Mechanics of Offering Alternatives \u201cWould you consider...?\u201d Those three words could become the most powerful words in your career. So as you're presenting these alternatives, think of them in three categories: 1) less, 2) more, and 3) older/newer. The key though, is to do all of this before you pick a product to show your client. A lot of salespeople offer alternatives too late in the sales process-often because they're desperate to close. Most of the time, this kind of thing happens because they weren't thorough in Step 2 and they've presented a product that doesn't solve the buyer's problem. Imagine a sale where you've presented numbers, you negotiated, and you can't close the deal because of money and then you say, \u201cLet's look at a lower-priced model.\u201d You're too late. You're timing's off. Your buyer has been with you for hours. They're going to think this is a waste of time. So although \u201cwould you consider...?\u201d is a powerful phrase, you've got to use it in the right place. Everything that we teach at Cardone Enterprises is about initiating. Be the horse, not the buggy. You want to initiate, not react. You want to predict and you want to differentiate. That's why you need to offer alternatives early in the process, not after you've tried to close someone. Think of offering alternatives as a service. It's not a trick or a manipulation, and it's not designed to help you. It's designed to help your buyer. It will, however, help you close more transactions and make sense of the proposal you're presenting. Think about it this way: If before showing or bringing something to your buyer-or having them test something out-you could offer to save them $500, $800, or even $1,000 dollars and they say no, but then later in the close they say the price is too high. Are you going to use this information? Would this not be a benefit to you in the negotiations? After all, by offering less or more during Step 3, I'm defining the parameters for negotiating. See, when I think in terms of negotiating with people, I'm always thinking, \u201cHow am I going to present?\u201d Basically, I want to position myself in this way: The less I have to negotiate, the less there is to negotiate. Most salespeople negotiate an infinite number of things from A to Z. I want to negotiate fewer items by bringing the parameters in. \u201cHey would you consider something to save yourself $800 or $1,200 dollars?\u201d (Rather than $3 or $4k.) See what I did there? I shortened the parameters down to $800-$1,200 dollars. Offering alternatives also gives your buyer an option to move and save face. Alternatives demonstrate that you're trying to save them money and be of service, so you can always return to that as a solution in the close without the buyer losing face. Let's talk about how that could work: Say you offer your buyer the chance to move down a step when you're offering alternatives. Now, let's fast forward to the close. Maybe you're struggling to get the deal done. You can easily say, \u201cThat's why I suggested the E model. Let's go look at it now.\u201d If you hadn't brought it up earlier, you couldn't move to it then because your buyer would lose face. See how offering alternatives can assist you even later in the close? Finally, there's one more problem that offering alternatives can solve: Customers who are complaining about price. Most salespeople think those buyers are on too much product and that's why they're complaining that it costs too much money. The opposite is actually true. Buyers who say it's too much money aren't on too much product. They're on too little product and what they're really saying is, \u201cIt's too much money for that product.\u201d Offer them a level up and you'll solve that problem. Remember: It's impossible to close someone on the wrong product. And it's impossible to get the right money on that wrong product. Initiate alternatives before the presentation, do it again before you enter negotiations, and you'll eliminate this problem, getting you that much closer to closing the deal. 5."

    "subsection_topic": "Presenting and Building Value",
    "text": "Presenting and Building Value Welcome back! Let's quickly direct ourselves to where we are right now. We're still in Step 3. And now that we've clarified that we have our buyer on the right product, it's time for us to give a presentation that builds value. And what's the outcome here? We need to demonstrate enough value to exceed the value of the buyer's money. If you've done other sales training, you may have heard this referred to as \u201cthe walk-around,\u201d \u201cthe demonstration,\u201d \u201cthe presentation,\u201d or \u201cthe demonstration presentation.\u201d Whatever you call it, know this: If you show your buyers absolutely everything, you're going to take too long, and you're going to overwhelm them. So our other main objective here is to know what to show your client-how to tailor your presentation to fit their wants and needs-and then show them the key features, advantages, and benefits. So, here's what I've got: a bottle of water. [FACILITATOR: Lift up a bottle of water.] How do I feature this? Is it convenient? Does it fit in my hand? Is the water great? Can I just throw it away when I'm done? Oops. Your buyer is walking away because he was interested in saving the planet. You said one thing too many. Before you start communicating, you need to understand what your buyer values. And where do you get this information? From Step 2. Otherwise, you could talk forever about a phone, a computer, a car, or a house and never get anywhere. So once you know what they want to hear, you need to talk about three things: the features, advantages, and benefits. Let's start with the first one: A feature. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a feature as \u201csomething offered on your product that's particularly attractive.\u201d So let's use a phone as our example. It fits in your hand. It fits in your pocket. That's not the advantage. That's what it is. The advantage is your higher ground, what you have that other people don't. In other words, how is this better than the competition or another solution? Example: Our phone is faster than any other phone in the marketplace right now. That gives me the high ground. Now, the benefit: What does your buyer get as a result of that advantage and that feature? You can spend less time waiting for stuff to download, so you can get more done and get back to whatever else you were doing that you interrupted to check your email. That's the benefit. Let's go back to our bottle of water. It's a bottle of water. That's the feature. It has a cap on it. Feature. Now, what's the advantage of that cap? The water doesn't fall out, right? What's the benefit? It makes this water easy to take anywhere. So with this bottle of water, let's say our advantage is that our water is capped and it's a smaller size that fits in your hand. The benefit? You can slip it in your pocket and take it with you, so you can stay hydrated wherever you go. We're going to dive into the feature, advantage, benefit concept in a moment, but there's one rule I want to cover first: Never show a feature without attaching an advantage and benefit. When you say, \u201cThe design is revolutionary,\u201d you want to tie the benefit into the buyer's dominant buying motive (DBM)-the \u201cwhy\u201d that's motivating their purchase today. Why is that feature important to that buyer? Good gas mileage: That's a feature. Advantage: Better gas mileage than any other car in its class. Benefit: Saves you at the gas pump, every time. Great for road trips with the kids. In just a minute, we're going to take some time and come up with a list of features, advantages, and benefits for the products you're working with. But first, I want to go a little deeper on these three concepts so you understand how you'll be using them during the Perfect Sales Process. 6."

    "text": "Features, Advantages, and Benefits I just gave you this rule: Never show a feature without attaching a benefit and an advantage. Now I want to go into the psychology behind that rule. It starts with understanding what features do. Sometimes, features actually work against you: They raise the price in the buyer's mind, and they can actually scare people. Let's say you start rattling off all these features: \u201cThe car has this, and this, and this. It's got everything. It's fully loaded.\u201d Depending on your buyer, they might start thinking, \u201cThis car is too expensive for me.\u201d That's not good. It could even scare your buyer off. So know this: Until you attach advantages to these features and also know how they benefit that customer, you're just talking. Talking does not build value. If you can't build value, you can't close the deal. This is one of the big mistakes salespeople make. Closers don't make this mistake. Advantages and benefits increase value, increase emotional attachment, and increase the urgency to own. Let's go through a couple of examples so you can continue to see how this works. [FACILITATOR: Demonstrate these in a rapid, easy pace, so you sound comfortable with these features, benefits, and advantages.] Feature: This model is fully loaded. Advantage: This model is outfitted with a special package deal that provides you with all these luxury features bundled at a lower cost. Benefits: Increased resale value and you get all the comforts and features at a lower cost. Feature: 22-inch wheels. Advantage: The car actually rides better, much more smoothly. Benefit: Higher resale value, more comfort for the entire family. Let's grab an example from another industry: Real estate. Feature: Large, open-plan first floor. Advantage: This model has more entertaining space than any other one we sell. Benefit: It's a great space for hosting parties with room for people to circulate, and you can cook and entertain at the same time. Feature: Three-car garage. Advantage: Most of the houses in this area only have a two-car garage. Benefit: You can keep your two cars out of the California sun and still have room for a workbench (or a home gym or a ping pong table for the kids-whatever lines up with the buyer's DBM). Did you hear how quickly and easily I rattled those off? Good. That's how you need to rattle them off. You need to know your features, advantages, and benefits cold, and they need to roll off your tongue with ease. But remember this: Every human being you will work with is different. While they all look for features, they give their money for the advantages and benefits. What you think is an advantage and a benefit may be things you'd pay for, but they may be ones I wouldn't pay for. That's where the answers you got in Step 2 come in. People pay for advantages and they pay for benefits-but they only pay for the ones that matter to them. When you get this right, advantages and benefits create an emotional connection, an urgency. There's no need to push them to buy. They want it. And it all starts with anchoring down these advantages and benefits. 7."

Know this: If they didn't want to improve their situation in some way, they would not be shopping. So what you need to understand is: What do they want and why do they want it? Let's take the example of buying a car. Most people already have a car. So why do they want another one? Are they looking for safety? Dependability? Appearance? Ego? Economy? Comfort? Performance? What is it? Maybe your buyer's just got a bug, and he's thinking, \u201cI've just got to have a new Tesla.\u201d Your job is to find out what they want, why they want it, and what they will pay for it today. I mentioned it earlier: This concept is called the dominant buying motive. I want to dig a little deeper into this concept with you. \u201cDominant\u201d means \u201ccommanding, controlling, or prevailing over all others,\u201d right? \u201cMotive\u201d means \u201ca need or desire that causes a person to act.\u201d So I'm looking for what? The commanding thing that causes your buyer to act. You should always be crystal clear on this. What is that motive, that one thing (or two things) that will cause this person to do something? You need to know this before you demonstrate and before you close. What is that one thing above all things that will cause a person to take action? Your product has hundreds, maybe even thousands of features. But only a few of them are required to get the sale. Understanding your buyer's dominant buying motives will tell you what you need to show them. Those questions we asked in Step 2: Determine Wants and Needs will come in here. Questions like, \u201cWhat's the single most important benefit that you hope to accomplish in your next purchase? What is the second most important benefit of your next purchase? If you could accomplish one thing with your next purchase, what would it be? What is it that your present situation doesn't offer you that's a must-have?\u201d If you've asked those questions, you'll understand the why. That will tell you how to present and build value, and it will show you how to close. Now, there's an easy way to break down these dominant buying motives. We call it \u201cAPES.\u201d It offers you an easy way to remember the four major reasons people buy things. A: Appearance - It makes the buyer look good. P: Performance - It makes them feel good in one way or another, maybe because it's faster, smaller, lighter, etc. E: Economical - It saves them money-or worry. S: Security - It makes them feel safe and secure. Let's look at this when it comes to phones. Appearance - Some people love the look of the iPhone, and that's why they bought theirs. Performance - The cameras on these phones and the speed is only getting better. That might motivate some buyers. Economical -Some people choose their phone because AT&T or another carrier will give it to them at a very low price or for free. Security - Maybe you've dropped your phone in the toilet and you can't afford to be without a cell phone in case it dies on you. You're buying a new one for security and dependability. Let's take another example from our class here today. [FACILITATOR: Ask one student to share their product and go through the APES for that product.] So with your buyers, you'll find their why in one of the APES. And maybe they're working with two-one dominant buying motive that's supported by another. Every day people spend money to acquire A-P-E-S, APES. Find out which one is most important to your buyers, and you'll know how to build value in your presentation-and how to close them. 8."

    "subsection_topic": "Controlling the Presentation",
    "text": "Controlling the Presentation Now that we've got the psychology of the presentation nailed, I'm going to go into the mechanics. Master these strategies step by step, and you'll control your presentation from start to finish, building value in your buyer's mind and moving you toward the close. #1: If needed, start by assuring your buyer-over and over again, if necessary-about price. Particularly price-sensitive people may be anxious to get the price, and it's your job to assure them that the price will be right. If you hear these fears in your buyer, reassure them at the start of your presentation with language like \u201cI'll handle the price. Don't worry about it. If you don't buy because of price, it will be my fault.\u201d Or: \u201cI assure you, I'll make the price right; if I'm unable to, I don't expect you to buy here. The most it will cost you is ten minutes of your time.\u201d Or: \u201cYou let me handle the price. Let's just make sure this is the right product/the right house/the right insurance for you.\u201d Make sure you do this before you start presenting. Next, #2: Ask permission to present the product. Now, why permission? Your goal in every situation is to get complete and total control while you're presenting. You need to command and demand attention, and the best way to do that is to get agreement first. You might say something like, \u201cSir, would you allow me just a few minutes to show you the features, advantages, and benefits of your new _____?\u201d Once they say \u201cyes,\u201d you're ready to transition into your presentation. One more distinction here that's going to make you even more effective: Address time when you ask for permission. Give them a time frame to set their expectations. This works really well for time-sensitive buyers. Here's how you can frame it: \u201cSir, would you allow just a few minutes to show you the features, advantages, and benefits of your new _____? It will only take about ten minutes, and you'll know everything you need to know about the product.\u201d Remember, control is critical and in the presentation, to keep it, you must be interesting. You're no longer being interested in them, you're now going to be interesting. \u201cMa'am, would you allow me just a few minutes to show you the features, advantages, and benefits of your new ______?\u201d Once you get agreement, set their expectations by saying something like, \u201cGreat, this is what I'm going to do: I'm going to start right here and I'm going to end up right here. As I do, if you have any questions, stop me, and I'll be happy to explain.\u201d We're going to talk more about where you start and finish in a minute. But for now, just note that you want to give your buyer a little overview and it's always good to invite questions. Next, #3: Choose the right setting. This is important for two reasons. First of all, it ensures that you're in an environment where you have your buyer's full attention. For example, let's say you're selling phones. When you're demonstrating the phone you've selected, you don't want the buyer looking at 54 other phones. You want her to focus on the one you've selected, and you want it to actually move her emotionally. So take it out of inventory, if you can, and move her to a quieter place to look at the phone. If you're selling cars, consider driving to a quiet and appealing location before you do the demonstration. Ideally, this is a place that will make it easy for your buyer to focus on the features, advantages, and benefits you're about to present. This gives you their full attention. Second, when you say something like, \u201cMa'am, follow me. I want to show you something,\u201d that puts you in control. \u201cSit here, I want to show you something.\u201d \u201cLet's take a ride. You have to see this.\u201d These are both control mechanisms for your presentation demonstration. Use them to command and demand attention. Next, #4: Deliver the actual presentation and break it into parts. No matter what product you're selling-an insurance policy, a car, a phone, a house, a seminar you're going to deliver-you need to break it down into parts. At Cardone Enterprises, we think of it as a clock. You're going to break every product presentation into one of two configurations: 1 Four Parts: Midnight, three o'clock, six o'clock, and nine o'clock, or 2 Six Parts: Midnight, two o'clock, four o'clock, six o'clock, eight o'clock, and ten o'clock. All products, regardless of what you're selling-even intangibles like an insurance contract-can be broken down in a similar fashion. The idea is that you mentally hit each step of the process, control that presentation, and touch on the points that are vital, the ones that line up to your buyer's dominant buying motives. Then each time you complete a part, ask the question: \u201cHave you seen enough to make a decision?\u201d After all, there's no need to do a two-hour presentation if you nailed it in 12 minutes. If not, if they want more information, keep going. Here's an example: Let's say I'm selling a car. My customer has said he's most interested in the interior. So that's where I'm going to start. That would be midnight. Then I'll ask the question: \u201cHave you seen enough to make a decision?\u201d If not, I'll show him the front and engine. That would be two o'clock, and I'll ask again. Then the passenger side and that side of the vehicle would be four o'clock. The rear trunk would be six o'clock. The driver's side and that side of the vehicle would be eight o'clock. Then I put him in the driver's seat, that would be ten o'clock. Now, here's the big key to making this work. The last part of your presentation should end up where you want to move the demonstration into the hands of the customer. For example, notice in the car example that my clock finished with my buyer in the driver's seat. I wanted him to start to assume ownership by ending up behind that wheel. Now, let's say your buyer is interested in a Rolls Royce Ghost and she's mostly going to be riding in the back seat. Shift your clock, so you end the presentation there and she can experience exactly what it's like to own the car. What does this tell you? You always need to understand where you want this presentation to end. So as you put yours together, be thinking about that. And what else does this tell you? That you need to know all these parts perfectly-boom, boom, boom, boom-so you can hit the points that line up with your buyer's dominant buying motives and end them in a place where they can really start to experience ownership. Remember, what's the key? Practice until you're fluid, not mechanical. At the end of the day, you only have so much time with these people. You have to know what you're doing. You've got to know exactly where you're going to start and how you're going to end, and you have to know it cold. 9."

    "subsection_topic": "The Rules",
    "text": "The Rules Now that we've covered the psychology and the mechanics of your presentation, let's go over a few rules to help you keep the Perfect Sales Process moving forward smoothly. Rule #1: Always, always, always control the presentation. Slow the process down if you have to, in order to maintain control. For example, let's say your buyer keeps taking phone calls while you're presenting. Ask for permission: \u201cSir, would you mind giving me five minutes without a call? I promise you it will be worth your while. Worst case, I waste five minutes. But I promise you, I'll never waste your time.\u201d Maintain control. You've got one shot. Your presentation will be the one thing that determines the value of the product and how much money you get for it in the close. It also determines how easy that close is going to be for you, so always maintain control. Rule #2: Make sure your product is presentation-ready-in other words, perfect. At a basic level if you're using a product as a demo, does it work? Is the battery charged? Is it clean? Maybe you're selling an insurance policy. Do you have the terms neatly printed out in an attractive package so that you can review them with your buyer? Don't present products that aren't ready. There's nothing worse than turning the key to discover the car won't start. It's going to bring all your momentum to a halt. Rule #3: Always, always drive the demonstration before you allow the other person to drive, test, or use the product. Start by driving your demonstration. Get people comfortable with what your product does and what it can't do-and you want to control what they're looking at. Rule #4: Then turn control of the demonstration over after you have set the stage. In other words, set it up first, then give your buyer the opportunity to take control and experience it for themselves. But there's one thing you want to do before that. Rule #5: Make people comfortable before turning over controls. Make sure they understand how to work the product. Remember, you're trying to put the buyer at ease. Think about what it was like to use an iPhone for the first time. If you were used to a flip phone with all those buttons, it was a little confusing to have just this single, round button in the middle of the phone. Confusion does not put the buyer at ease, so make sure you establish a level of comfort. And keep the environment as consistent as possible. This is more for those of you taking someone on a test drive. A lot of variables can crop up, so use a pre-planned route. That way, you can focus on putting the buyer at ease and helping them assume ownership, rather than trying to navigate unfamiliar streets. Rule #6: Use assumptive statements. We'll talk about this more in just a few minutes. But for now, I want you to think about using language that establishes mental ownership. We call it assumptive language. For example: \u201cWhat would you like to add to your new car?\u201d or \u201cIf you want to turn the air conditioning down on your new car, you'll find the control right here.\u201d We'll cover this in more detail because it's a powerful psychological tool for creating desire in your buyer. Rule #7: Reassure price concerns any time your buyer brings up price. If they crop up again in the middle of the demonstration. Don't ignore these questions such as: \u201cBut how much is it going to be?\u201d or \u201cWhat are my payments going to be?\u201d or \u201cWhat's the price on this model?\u201d Reassure your buyer. You can say something as simple as, \u201cLet me show you all the features and benefits of this new model, and then we can sit down to work out some figures that I think you'll find agreeable.\u201d Rule #8: Superfreak your presentation. This is a signature concept of Grant's, and what it means is for you to commit to your presentation with the highest levels of enthusiasm and energy so that you make an unforgettable impression. If your buyer went to three different places, they'd remember you as the person who was so positive and so enthusiastic that you absolutely blew everyone else away. 10."

    "subsection_topic": "Assumptives",
    "text": "Assumptives Now that you know the rules, I promised we'd talk a little more about assumptive statements. Assumptives are our way of maintaining an attitude and language of agreement and ownership. In other words, you're projecting into the future, getting people to mentally take ownership. When you're using this kind of language, your buyer will start thinking things like, \u201cHey, maybe this is my next car. Can I see myself pulling into the driveway in this? Will it fit in my garage?\u201d The word \u201cassume\u201d means \u201cto take as granted or true.\u201d This is what you're doing by using assumptive language. You're counting the sale as true-as a done deal-and reinforcing that future by using language that helps your buyer project mentally where they want to go. \u201cWill your new car fit in your garage?\u201d or \u201cDoes your new phone fit in your pocket? Check it out.\u201d See what I'm doing there? Those words project ownership. Here's another one: \u201cDo you have your own covered parking space at the office where you'll park your new car?\u201d Or: \u201cThe performance of your new laptop is the best in its class. That's important to you, right?\u201d How about: \u201cHow often will you use your phone for work?\u201d You could also say: \u201cWill anyone else be involved in advising you in the purchase of your new...\u201d See what am I doing? I'm finding out whether there's another decision-maker involved and instilling ownership. Get their senses involved: \u201cFeel the fit and finish of your new...\u201d Or: \u201cSee how easy it is to access all the controls of your new...\u201d Maybe it feels hokey to you, but I can tell you that this kind of language-\u201cyour new vehicle,\u201d \u201cyour new phone,\u201d \u201cyour new house\u201d- works. Mental ownership precedes every purchase no matter how small or how large. Whether you're buying a pack of gum or walking into a casino, you did it in your mind first. It has to happen in your mind, and it has to happen in the buyer's mind before it will ever happen in reality. Learn to assume the close and do it in Step 3. We're also going to do it when we cover trial closes. More about that in the next step of the Perfect Sales Process. 11."

    "subsection_topic": "Objections to the Presentation",
    "text": "Objections to the Presentation As with every step in the Perfect Sales Process, you're going to get objections to your presentation. Let's take a few minutes and talk about how to handle them while keeping the sale moving forward. Let's say you're headed into your presentation to build value and as soon as you start, your customer shuts you down and says, \u201cLook, I don't need to do this. I don't need to see how it operates. I don't need to try it on. I don't need to see it. I already saw it online. I buy one of these every two years, so I don't need to do this. I don't have time for this. I know all about it. I looked at it with your competition. All I need is a price. I don't have time.\u201d If you've been doing this for any length of time, you've heard all this already. However, you need to know how to handle these objections. Otherwise, you're going to let this buyer make you shortcut your presentation and you're going to lose control of the sale. More importantly, you're not going to get the chance to build value. And if you don't build value, you're not going to close the deal. If the buyers don't know it will solve their problems and don't love it, they will not take action. It just won't happen. So first, understand that most of the things these people are telling you, these objections, they're just what? They're reactions. Don't treat them as valid objections. They're just talk. Handle them as such. Dissolve the conflict and agree with your buyer. She says: \u201cI don't need to see how it works, [STUDENT NAME].\u201d You say, \u201cI understand. I didn't ask you to see how it works. I only asked you to allow me to show you the unseen benefits of your new investment.\u201d See how I'm handling it? Maybe your buyer says: \u201cI know all about it already.\u201d You say, \u201cI understand that and I appreciate that. What I'll show you is that there have been some recent changes you may not be familiar with. Watch this.\u201d Agree with them and dissolve the conflict. With these objections, your buyer is trying to talk you out of your presentation. They're trying to talk you out of building value. Don't let it happen. Here's another response you could use: \u201cSir, I understand and would not allow you to even consider doing business with me if you aren't completely educated about what you're getting for your money. Look, it takes just five minutes, maybe even just four.\u201d Here's a response for those time-sensitive buyers who say things like: \u201cI don't have time to go through this.\u201d Your response? \u201cI know how valuable your time is and I promise not to waste it. Allow me the courtesy of five minutes. Follow me.\u201d Or to take it to another level-the Super Freak level-with a buyer who says, \u201cI don't need to do this,\u201d you could say: \u201cIf you determine that what I'm about to show you is a waste of time, I'll buy you and your wife lunch. Is that agreeable?\u201d The bottom line here is this: You have to be completely committed to the presentation, especially when you're handling objections around it. If you think the presentation is a waste of time or that the person in front of you isn't a buyer, you just won't pull this off. You have to be completely convinced that the presentation is of value to the client and it is of value to your profession. Insist on the presentation. Don't be talked out of it. Go all the way with it. You'll close more deals and you'll make more money. Period. 12."

    "subsection_topic": "Mistakes in the Presentation",
    "text": "Mistakes in the Presentation Now, let's take a look at the common mistakes that salespeople make in Step 3 of the Perfect Sales Process. I'm sharing these with you so that you can catch yourself early if you are making these mistakes, stop what you're doing, course correct, and keep the sale moving forward. By the way, if you manage other salespeople, these mistakes are great to review regularly in your sales meetings. Now, bar none, the #1 mistake you can make around a presentation is to not do one at all. Do one with every customer, every time, no exception to the rule. Don't let yourself get talked out of one. Don't let yourself believe that you're not talking to a buyer, so it's not worth your time. Instead, you need to be so confident in your presentation that you know you can change someone's mind, which means all those excuses just go out the window. And how will you get there? Practice. You've got to know all the parts cold. You've got to know where you're starting and where you're ending, and then you do what we call \u201cSuperfreaking the presentation.\u201d More on that in a moment. But first, let's talk about the rest of the mistakes. Mistake #2: You ask if they want to drive, use, or hold the product. Mistake. Remember who's selling who here. Don't ask. Control the sale. Mistake #3: You don't believe the buyer is going to buy today. Another mistake. In your mind, you have to know they're going to buy. You have to believe they're going to buy-even before they're going to believe it. Because, let's be honest, some buyers don't believe they're going to do it. You have to convince yourself of the sale. See the deal before the deal happens and believe it. Mistake #4: Here's another belief that will trip you up: You don't really believe that the presentation influences people. You don't think a killer presentation actually causes people to pay more. This is a mistake. Mistake #5: You take your product for granted because you're around it every day. Look, every day you spend time with your product. It's almost inevitable that you'd start to take even some of its most powerful advantages and benefits for granted. But this is a mistake. Don't forget what's great about your product-and what it can do for your buyer. Mistake #6: You start believing the buyer when they say, \u201cPrice is the only thing that matters.\u201d That's a mistake. Price is never the reason anybody buys anything. It is never the reason. If your buyer doesn't love it and it doesn't solve his or her problems, the price can't get low enough. So while price may be important and while they may grind you on price-\u201dhow much, how much, how much\u201d-you still have to build value in your presentation or you won't get any money from them in the close. Mistake #7: You use slang or technical words that your buyer doesn't understand. Every industry has verbiage, nomenclature, slang. When you use it with buyers, it turns people off. Avoid it. Mistake #8: You forget to tie advantages and benefits to the features. Remember, the feature is the 22-inch wheels. What are the advantages and what are the benefits? Mistake #9: You aren't enthusiastic. You just go through the motions. That's a waste of time. Anything you do, it's worth doing with enthusiasm. Halloween with your son or daughter, for example. You may not want to do it. But if you tell your partner you're going to do it, if you're showing up for your child, it's worth showing up with enthusiasm. The same is true of your 104,000th presentation. Mistake #10: You don't control the presentation. You let them control the presentation. If you can't control the presentation, I promise you, you will not control the sale, and you will not control the close. Mistake #11: You don't know \u201cthe why.\u201d Do you remember \u201cthe why,\u201d the one reason your buyer wants what you have, that dominant buying motive? Without this, you'll haphazardly and awkwardly wander through your presentation. Always enter the presentation knowing \u201cthe why\u201d and the second \u201cwhy.\u201d The APES can make it easy for you, so learn that acronym inside and out. Mistake #12: You don't continue to use assumptives. Remember those assumptives- \u201dyour new phone\u201d and \u201cyour new car?\u201d You need them to build mental ownership. Leaving them out is a mistake. Mistake #13: You demonstrate what the product is worth, when what you should be demonstrating is double that value. Here's what I mean by that. If I'm selling a $100,000 product, I want to do a $200,000 presentation. If I'm selling a $30 book, I want to do at least a $60 presentation and, even better, a $600 presentation. Why? Because nobody's going to give you $30 for a product if it's only worth $30. It's got to be worth more than that. In other words, your buyer will not give you money until the value of your product exceeds the value of his or her money. So those are the most common mistakes we see salespeople make in this area. Now, let's talk about a couple of final distinctions in this step. 13."

    "subsection_topic": "Sell Yourself",
    "text": "Sell Yourself When we started out this morning, we talked about the Perfect Sales Process as a way of helping your buyers get to know, trust, and believe in three things: you, your company, and your proposal. So I want to remind you that when you're presenting the product, you're not just selling the product, you're also selling yourself and your company. Like the product, you have to take the time to share the features, advantages, and benefits of buying from you and your company. Here's why this is so important: Anything you're selling-a car, a phone, a trinket, a widget, a plumbing service, whatever it is-it can be shopped. You and your company cannot be shopped. The way I approach it is this: I'm an original. I don't come with every deal. If I sell suits, you can go buy this same brand of suit down the street. However, I don't come with it. So I have to sell myself, my company, and the service of the company while I'm selling the fabric and the fit of the suit. When someone buys a product, they're also buying a company. Most salespeople never touch this. So as you're doing your presentation, don't forget to include everything else that comes along with the purchase: you, the support staff, the online support, the location, anything that you do to support your client. Because let's face it: Your product can be bought anywhere. So what are the advantages and benefits of doing business with you? These have to be intertwined with your product presentation. Let's say a customer says to you: \u201cI can buy it cheaper down the street with so-and-so.\u201d You know what I'd say? \u201cYou know what, I hear you. And let's assume that you can, but know that you don't get me anywhere else. I don't come with the deal down the street, which means you don't get the 24/7 access to me when you need something. You've met them. You've met me, and you wouldn't be sitting with me if you were completely confident in them. You know there's a difference just from meeting us both.\u201d Don't forget to sell yourself. Don't forget to sell your company. And get strong about it. Remember earlier today when we did an exercise and you sold yourself on you, your product and your company? Learn that list. Weave it into your presentation, and you'll sell so much more than just trinkets, widgets, and contracts. Last, I want to give you one final piece to think about. 14."

    "subsection_topic": "Superfreak the Presentation",
    "text": "Superfreak the Presentation Answer this question for me: Freak or Super Freak? In Grant's opinion, and mine, there's only one answer: Superfreak. Freaks are a dime a dozen. Super Freaks sign big contracts. You want to be a Super Freak. So when it comes to your presentation, I want you to superfreak it. Go all out. Give it every ounce of enthusiasm you have. Go from being interested to being interesting. Most presentations put you to sleep. Do what you need to do to get people's attention and build the most compelling and interesting presentation they've ever seen. Use descriptive language that sticks with them. I once had a guy sell me a banner for a trade show and he told me it was made out of the same stuff that they use to make bulletproof panels. Do you think I remembered that? Absolutely. And was I willing to invest in it because I believed it would last? Absolutely. So when it comes to your presentations, always Superfreak them. Sell your product, sell your company, and sell yourself with more enthusiasm and energy than anyone else so that you build high value and differentiate yourself from everyone else in the marketplace. Now, we're going to take a quick break, then move into Step 4 of the Perfect Sales Process. Part 6: Steps of The Sales Process - Step 4: Make Proposal 1."

    "text": "What Is a Trial Close? Welcome back! In this section, we're going to cover the next step of the Perfect Sales Process, Step 4: Make Proposal. First, we're going to start with a rule: Always, always make a proposal- with figures-to every person you greet. After all, if you don't present to our buyer, you can never come to an agreement with them. And ideally, you want to deliver your proposal within 40 minutes of making contact, although that number will vary a little, depending on your industry. Now if you're feeling at all skeptical of making a proposal to everyone you greet, I want you to know that this is something that Cardone Enterprises has tested and proven. In fact, we recently worked with a retail group in Boston and focused them on one main objective: presenting more proposals with figures. This alone resulted in $350,000 in gross profits in one month. That's six figures of proof right there. Now before we get into the actual write-up of your proposal, I want to introduce you to a technique that you'll use before you actually sit down and present figures. It's called the \u201ctrial close.\u201d The trial close is a kind of test. Trial closing questions can help you test the client's level of ownership over the product you're showing them. They're designed to give you a sense of what they're thinking and feeling about your product or service, and how to adjust your proposal so you can actually make the sale. They're basically a way of taking your buyer's temperature. And here's the best part: Not only are trial closes valuable, but they're also low risk. Now, these can technically be done anywhere within the Perfect Sales Process, but they're most powerful here, before you do the actual proposal. Now to be clear, you're not asking for a decision with a trial close. That's what you're doing in the close. Instead, in the trial close, you're asking for an opinion. For example, your trial close could be, \u201cSir, on a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your new vehicle?\u201d See, you're asking for an opinion, not a decision. The close would be, \u201cIf there are no other questions, I just need your name here and here.\u201d Now here's the best part: When you use a trial close, you'll often get new information. When I ask things like, \u201cOn a scale from 1 to 10...\u201d I'm going to get new data from the customer. Your goal with that information is to understand two things: 1) Do I have this buyer on the right product, and 2) Does the customer now own it mentally? Those are the ultimate goals of the trial close. Now, let's talk about a couple of different options you can use for your trial close: \u201cIt looks like you really like this model. Is that true?\u201d \u201cIf you took it home, would you be proud to own this?\u201d \u201cDo you prefer the larger or smaller version?\u201d \u201cHow would it look at your home?\u201d \u201cWhere would you take your first trip in your new RV?\u201d What do you notice about each of these? They put ownership in the customer's mind, right? But it's still different than, \u201cIf I could get the figures agreeable, would you take delivery right now?\u201d Instead, trial close questions allow us to check out where the buyer is. It's like cooking a dish using a recipe. Is the oven hot enough? Is the water boiling yet? Does our buyer have mental ownership? At the end of the day, the trial close is both your lowest risk and your best friend. Let's talk more about why this is true. 2."

    "subsection_topic": "Establishing Mental Ownership",
    "text": "Establishing Mental Ownership Now that you're starting to embrace the idea of the trial close, I want to talk about using trial close questions earlier in the Perfect Sales Process. I'm sure you've heard that phrase \u201calways be closing\u201d or \u201cABC.\u201d Here's what that phrase means to me: You can drop in trial closes earlier in the process, such as during Step 2: Determine Wants and Needs. Think about some of the language we talked about earlier: \u201cSo what do you want your new investment to do that your present one doesn't do? Does this accomplish that? What do you want your new phone/your new house/your investment/the addition that you want us to build to do that your present one doesn't accomplish?\u201d Do you see how these are also trial close questions? A few more for you to consider: \u201cWho will be the primary user or beneficiary? Who will be the greatest beneficiary of this new decision? Who will be the secondary user of your new purchase? Who will be the secondary beneficiary? Who else is going to benefit? Who else will benefit from the selection you make today? What other benefits would you like to achieve in picking out this product, making this decision, or starting with this project?\u201d These are all really trial closes that start to give your buyer mental ownership, take their temperature, and give you more information for your presentation. As you get more comfortable with trial closes, from time to time, drop in some of these questions along the way: \u201cLet me ask you, assuming we could work something like this out, whose name would go on the title?\u201d \u201cWhat do you like the most about what I've shown you thus far?\u201d \u201cWhat's the greatest benefit you've seen so far?\u201d Now at this point, I usually get some objections from students in the room: \u201cWhoa, [FACILITATOR NAME]. I'm not ready to go that fast or put that much pressure on the buyer. It's way too soon.\u201d Look, here's what I don't want you to do: Don't go on with your 35-minute presentation because you think you've got to do a 35-minute presentation. Remember, trial closes are low risk. You can ask one of these after 12 minutes. You can even ask one every six to eight minutes. I'm talking about just simple things like, \u201cWhat do you like so far? Do you have enough information to make a decision yet? What other information would you want?\u201d Or: \u201cIs there anything you'd want me to add or change based on what I've shown you thus far? Is there anything you don't see yourself using that I've shown you? Is there anything here that you wouldn't use, that you'd want to delete, or that you don't see value in?\u201d Trial closes. \u201cWell, where would you use a product like this first? Who would you show it to first? What are the first benefits that you would expect from owning this? Let's put it aside here where no one else can claim it while I show you how easy it is to do business here.\u201d That's language to use when you're getting towards the end of the presentation, and what does it do? That's right: It starts to give your buyer mental ownership. \u201cJohn, whose name would you want to title this in? Your name? Your spouse's name? Or both? Did you want to register this in your name or the company's name?\u201d These are all trial closes. \u201cWho would your insurance coverage be with?\u201d Why would I ask that, even when the buyer and I haven't even worked out a deal yet? Here's why: Because all your buyer has to do is answer the name of the insurance company, and it keeps the sale moving forward. We're going to do an exercise here in just a moment to develop a few trial closes of your own. But before we do that, I want to address the other big objection we get: \u201cI sell to high-end clients and this trial close thing won't work.\u201d We actually had a customer say that to us. So what did we do? Cardone Enterprises went out there for a day and worked with him, using trial closes with every one of his customers. This was a $240,000 average ticket product, so we'd say something like this to his customers: \u201cLet me ask you, for $240,000, would there be any changes or additions you'd want to make to this?\u201d Now sure, we heard things like, \"No, but I'm not buying today, though.\" So what did we say in response? \u201cI understand you're not buying today. Let me put it aside here while we go work up numbers, okay? So that when we do come to a decision, nobody else will grab it up, okay?\u201d And he'd say something like, \"Yeah, yeah, sure. Let's go sit down.\" Did it work? Sure. It moved us forward. And we closed a lot of those deals. So keep this in mind: It has nothing to do with the product you're selling or the price you're selling. Trial closes give your buyers mental ownership and they keep moving the sale forward. Learn them and use them. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "Objections to Trial Closes",
    "text": "Objections to Trial Closes Now, I hinted at this next topic already: objections to trial closes. What did the buyer say in my example? \u201cBut I'm not buying today.\u201d That's an objection, right? Here's the deal: Once you start using all these trial closes, you're going to have people shutting you down. I promise you: This is going to happen. You'll hear things like: \u201cHey, I'm not buying today! What are you talking about? I didn't say I was doing something today! Why do you keep assuming that I'm going to buy? I don't think I can even afford anything.\u201d \u201cSlow down! This is the first place we've been to! We never buy at the first place.\u201d Does this sound familiar? \u201cGive me a copy of what I'm looking at and I'll think about it. I never make a rash decision.\u201d Now, here's what I want you to understand when you hear those things: That doesn't mean your trial close didn't work. It's actually moving you forward. Why? Because it's still giving your buyers images of mental ownership. And here's what's so important about that: Once someone takes mental ownership, money is never the reason people don't buy. Once they own it up here [FACILITATOR: Tap head], they actually start trying to work out the numbers: \u201cAm I going to be able to afford this? How am I going to make this happen?\u201d It doesn't mean they're not going to keep saying things and say, \u201cHey, hey, slow down!\u201d And, yes, I've really heard that one. Your job is to know that you're still moving forward toward mental ownership. And as a side note, if you really want to master scenarios like this, come spend a few days at one of our Cardone Enterprises events. We spend days role-playing situations like this, so you can handle objections like this easily. I'll be honest, none of these objections would throw me off, because I've trained on them until I'm fluid, not mechanical. In fact, here's how I would handle something like this: I might say, \u201cHey, come on inside to my office. By the way, who's your insurance going to be on your new purchase?\u201d And maybe my buyer says: \u201cHey, hey, hey, [FACILITATOR NAME], slow down. Why are you talking about my insurance? I didn't say I was buying this.\u201d And I'd just say: \u201cHey, I know you're not. I'm with you. I'm just wondering who you're going to insure it with when you do make a decision.\u201d \u201cOh, well, I'm going to go with State Farm (or any other insurance company.)\u201d \u201cExcellent! Follow me.\u201d See? It's happening and it's working. Don't give up on your trial closes. They're moving you closer to ownership with each one. Now that your trial close has 1) shown you that you have your buyer on the right product and 2) he or she is taking mental ownership, you can move into the next part of this step: the actual proposal. 4."

    "subsection_topic": "You Need to Make Proposals to Everyone",
    "text": "You Need to Make Proposals to Everyone Now we're moving into what Grant likes to call the \u201cmack daddy\u201d section of the Perfect Sales Process: the actual proposal, also called the write- up. No matter what you call it, I think you'll agree with him that the proposal is critical because the only way to sell someone is to make them a proposal. First, let's get specific with what we mean by \u201cproposal\u201d or \u201cwrite-up\u201d because a lot of people think of it differently. This is where you come up with a proposal-the price and the terms-in an effort to get an agreement. It doesn't mean a close. It doesn't mean you've sold anything. In this step, you create a proposal that you share with your buyer. Now I hinted at this before, but I want to emphasize this again: When it comes to making proposals, you likely already do them, but you probably don't do them enough. At the Cardone Enterprises, we make proposals to everyone we greet. That's what we do. Why? Because we're not interested in a high closing ratio. We're interested in taking buyers all the way. The average company delivers proposals to fewer than 40% of the opportunities that walk through their door. That limits you. If you don't write somebody up, make a proposal, enter negotiations, and show them what you can do, you can't close anyone. For whatever reason, these companies are deciding somehow that 60% of the people that come to them are either not ready, can't buy, can't be sold, or are not qualified. So why do we present proposals to 100% of our opportunities at the Cardone Enterprises? Because you have nothing to lose. And I'll tell you what: The buyer might change their mind when you're writing them up. I've had people sit down after telling me 17 times, \u201cI will not buy, no matter what.\u201d Now when I initially present my numbers, they might say, \u201cToo high, this doesn't work.\u201d But 15 minutes later I'll hear, \u201cI can't believe I'm doing this. I really didn't think I was going to buy today.\u201d And how did I get there? Because I made a proposal-with figures. If you don't write someone up, you can't close them. Fact. Are you worried you're going to lose control of the selling process? Control of the selling process comes from being prepared and taking each of the steps in the Perfect Sales Process. You don't lose it because you presented somebody with numbers. If you're still skeptical, let me ask you this: When you get to the last three days of the quarter and you're under, who do you write up? Everyone, right? You throw out all the rules and you write everyone up. And what happens? You make your numbers. Here's what I want you to come away with after this section: The more people you present with a proposal, the more people will buy because you have to make a proposal in order to get a close. If you want to hit the ball, you've got to swing the bat. In this section, I'm going to show you how to do it better than you've ever done it before. 5."

    "subsection_topic": "Excuses for Not Making Proposals",
    "text": "Excuses for Not Making Proposals Now, I mentioned before that the average company doesn't make proposals to 60% of the people who walk through the door. There are a few reasons why, and every one of them is an excuse. Let's go through a few of them, so you can recognize them as they pop up: 1. The buyer won't commit. They're \u201cjust looking,\u201d so why write them up? This is the biggest one. 2. The buyer owes too much or is unable to somehow handle some part of the financing or situation involved. 3. The buyer doesn't have the money to pay for the product. 4. The buyer won't pay enough. They're going to offer too little money. 5. The decision maker isn't there. The Vice President didn't bring the CEO. The wife didn't bring the husband. 6. The buyer does not have enough time today, but they'll come back when they do. You're deluding yourself if you believe this one, by the way. If they're in a hurry today, I promise you, they're going to be in a hurry on Saturday. 7. The buyer doesn't have all the elements involved in this transaction that you need to look at. For example, they want to buy a car and they didn't bring their trade-in. You can make all the excuses you want to make. I'm still going to make a proposal to everyone. Look, if I write up 100 people and you write up ten, who's going to sell more, just from a pure numbers standpoint? I'd put my money on me. Here's the mindset I want you to embrace: Be completely unreasonable and provide proposals to everyone. No exceptions-even when they say, \u201cHey, we're going to three other places when we leave here.\u201d When I hear that, do you know what I think? I think: \u201cI'm making you a proposal right now. Because I'd rather write you up now than write you up after you go to three more places, when there's no meat left on the bone.\u201d Change the way you think about proposals. Get rid of your excuses and present them to who? Everyone. 6."

    "text": "How to Increase Your Proposals Now just because you've decided to make a proposal to everyone, it doesn't mean you're always going to get them to keep moving through the Perfect Sales Process with you. So, let's talk about the ways you can increase your proposals and keep the sale moving forward. First, a quick review of the elements that will set you up to get here: 1. A great attitude, one that lowers your buyer's guard and puts them at ease. 2. The selection alternative, so you get your buyer on the right product. \u201cHey, would you consider going down a model?\u201d and \u201cWould you consider going up a model?\u201d Remember that one? 3. Meeting their objections and addressing their fears. We're going to talk about that in a minute. If you can't meet their objections-and you will get objections-you're not going to get to the proposal. 4. Understanding the risks and accepting them. Be willing to waste time with people who won't buy. That will happen. Know the risks and accept them. Why? Because more proposals mean more sales, which means more money. 5. Finally, reducing your chance of getting a \u201cno.\u201d That's all about the language you use. You don't want to say something like: \u201cHey, you want to buy this right now?\u201d That's probably going to get you a \u201cno.\u201d Instead, you're going to use language that assumes ownership and makes it easy to move to the next step: \u201cCome on inside and let me get you some numbers.\u201d Remember, you're not asking people to do something, you're asking them to move forward. You're asking people to come inside. \u201cLet me show what we can do for you.\u201d To make this happen, it takes a mindset shift on your part: You have to be willing to swing the bat and look bad. Closing ratios don't matter. You know what does? Making ten times more money. Which do you want? The money or the closing ratio? So increase your proposals. Get rid of the excuses. Drop the reasons for not bringing people in. And make a complete commitment to delivering proposals to absolutely everyone. 7."

    "text": "Language for Increasing Proposals Now, let's talk through some specific language that will help you increase your ability to present proposals even more. You can use these exactly as they are or you can adjust them to fit the products you're selling and the buyers you're working with. But don't change them too much. This is language that we've tested at Cardone Enterprises, so we know it works. 1. \u201cWhen would you want to take ownership of your new ________? I'm confident we can come to an agreement on the figures. Let's go work it out.\u201d What's happening there? I'm assuming the proposal. 2. \u201cWould there be any changes or additions you'd want me to make to your new ________ before we come to an agreement on the figures?\u201d Get the answer, and then say, \u201cExcellent, follow me.\u201d 3. \u201cFollow me. Allow me to provide you with figures that will make it easy for you to say yes to your new ________. Is that fair enough? Great. Come this way.\u201d What similarities are you seeing among these three examples I've shared so far? In every one of them, what am I saying so far? \u201cYours,\u201d \u201cfollow me.\u201d In other words, let's roll. 4. \u201cBefore we work on figures that you feel are fair, tell me, what do you like least about your new ________?\u201d Why would I ask that question? I want to find out what they don't like. Once they tell me, I use that information. \u201cThat wouldn't keep you from owning it, would it?\u201d You get your \u201cno,\u201d then you'd say, \u201cGreat, follow me.\u201d 5. \u201cWhat do you think the other drivers, your spouse, friends, parents, fellow employees, will think about your new ________?\u201d Notice that I'm trying to get mental ownership right here. Now, you may be wondering at this point: Aren't these like trial closes? Absolutely they are. Trial closes are your bridge. They segue you into the proposal. If you have a time-sensitive shopper-they're great, by the way, because they can make decisions fast-try this one: 6. \u201cI understand you're in a hurry today. Let's go to work on figures agreeable to you, so you can avoid wasting any more of your valuable time doing this. Follow me.\u201d With highly time-sensitive shoppers, sometimes you'll get some pushback. They might respond with something like, \u201c[FACILITATOR NAME], I've already been here 40 minutes.\u201d Keep that positive attitude and reply, \u201cI understand, but if you leave without information, you will have wasted those 40 minutes. Give me five minutes. I'm going to show you everything, and I'll leave it up to you.\u201d That's a simple way to handle time. So here's what you need to do with these. You need to learn these cold. You need these ready to go, so you can be fluid with them and you can whip them out in a heartbeat with a smile. 8."

We'll walk through a couple of common objections and I'm going to give you some ways to answer them. Like the language we went through earlier, you need to learn these cold too, so you're ready to deliver them easily without missing a beat-and keep the sale moving forward. Scenario #1: The buyer who says they need their spouse involved: \u201cI need to talk to my wife\u201d or \u201cI need to ask my husband.\u201d Your response: \u201cI appreciate the fact, sir, you want your wife involved\u201d or \u201cMa'am, I appreciate the fact you want your husband involved in the decision. Follow me so that we'll be able to provide your partner with the information necessary to arrive at an intelligent decision. Follow me.\u201d Or even more simply: \u201cI appreciate that, ma'am, and I would want that as well. I'd want that person involved. Follow me.\u201d Scenario #2: The buyer who says \u201cI'm not buying today.\u201d Your response: \u201cI understand you said earlier you're not buying today. I'd like you to allow me the courtesy to share with you what we would be willing to do if you were going to make a decision today. By the way, we'll certainly understand if you change your mind and take advantage of the big sale. Follow me.\u201d Here's another one. \u201cI understand you didn't expect to buy today and I wouldn't expect you to, unless the figures worked out to your favor. Let me show you how easy it is for us to do business together. Follow me.\u201d What do you think? Can you see yourself using that one? [FACILITATOR: Get assent before moving on.] Here's another one for \u201cI'm not buying today.\u201d You say: \u201cSir, that would be my fault, not yours. I take full, complete, 100% responsibility for your decision. Follow me.\u201d Scenario #3: The buyer who's missing something. You might hear something like, \u201cI can't buy today. I didn't bring my trade-in.\u201d There are a few scenarios in which your buyer will object because he or she doesn't have something. This could also work if your buyer says something like \u201cI haven't done enough shopping yet.\u201d You could say: \u201cI appreciate that you haven't done enough shopping yet,\u201d or \u201cthat you haven't brought your trade-in with you,\u201d or whatever the excuse. \u201cLet me suggest that we show you what we could do for you and I'll leave the final decision up to you. Come on inside and let's work it out.\u201d Or: \u201cSir, you don't need your trade-in right now. Truth is, what you need is enough information to find out whether you want to bring your vehicle back in here and have us look at it. Follow me.\u201d Scenario #4: The buyer who wants to cut through what they perceive as just talk: \u201cI just want your bottom line. I don't want to go inside. I don't want to do anything else.\u201d You could say: \u201cSir, there's nothing to go through. We're not going to have to jump over anything, and this isn't difficult. Let's get you some figures that you can agree to. I'll make it easy for you. Follow me.\u201d Scenario #5: The buyer who wants to put on the brakes. \u201cWe're going too fast here, I feel like we're going too fast. Honey, we're going too fast. Oh my gosh, we're going too fast.\u201d You say: \u201cSir, I didn't ask you to make a decision. All I asked you to do is come inside with me. Let me give you some figures, so you know what it's going to cost to own your new ________. Follow me.\u201d Scenario #6: The person who needs to talk to his or her bank. \u201cI've got to go to my credit union first.\u201d Easy answer: \u201cWhat do you say we give you enough information so that you have something to give your credit union? Because right now, if you go to the credit union, they're going to ask a lot of questions that you don't have the answers to, yet. Come on inside, and let me write it up, okay?\u201d These are some of the most common objections you're going to hear and you need to be ready to handle them all. You've got to get these answers down pat, rote, automatic, no ad-libbing. At the end of the day, there are a lot of variables, a lot of changes going on in selling, a lot of different personalities, and a lot of different customers. The more consistency that you can have with your own presentation, the more consistent the process is going to be, and the more consistent your results.

So that being said, if you really want to learn to become a pro-ninja- master closer who can easily handle any situation that a buyer throws at you, you need to devote yourself to the art of closing. Spend an entire day learning, practicing, and role-playing in the course we call Closing the Deal. Or, join us for a half-day session to study advanced strategies in closing, negotiations, and objections. Believe me, it's going to be more than worth your time. And here's why: In our experience, most salespeople, even seasoned ones who have been around a long time, struggle with controlling the sale through the negotiation and the close. In a way, it's not surprising because many have simply never invested real time, energy, and effort into learning the exact skills required. Learn to become a master of the close-not someone who dabbles or who treats sales like a hobby-but someone who maintains complete control of their environment all the way through the end of the sale. And frankly, why wouldn't anyone want this? Why even bother selling if you can't close? That's where 100% of your money is coming from. If this is you and you want to master the close, there are only two ways to learn: The first is from experience. This is the most costly way to go about it. Maybe you spend 13 years in sales and collect 13 years of losses, failures, and successes. Typically in sales, your failures stack up faster than your successes, and then you start coming up with your own ideas about what caused those failures. That's option #1: learning from experience. There's another way to learn: Instead of waiting for experience to teach you, you can create an experience and learn from that. I'm talking about anticipating scenarios, preparing scripts, and drilling responses- rehearsing experiences and situations. That's what we did today and you can expect more of if you decide to train in the art of closing. Keep partnering up, role-playing, and learning from those experiences you've created, rather than waiting for them to happen to you. Which one is faster, do you think? The second option, right? Creating experiences. Which one costs you more-not in the short term, but in the long term? The first option. Learning from experiences that happen to you. So, to sum it up: You can wait ten, 15, or 20 years for your personal experience to enlighten you or you can get enlightened now. Yes, it still takes some time. It takes discipline. It takes initiative, but it will go much faster if you can find a partner-or couple of partners-as committed as you are, so you can train together. Today, I'm going to get you started down that path, but I want you to recognize that this only is a start. The art of closing is one that's worth mastering. If that's something you want for yourself, just grab me at the end and we can talk more about it. Right now, though, we're going to talk about one of the most important distinctions I want you to make in this step: why you need an arsenal of closes. 2."

    "text": "Why You Need an Arsenal of Closes A great closer, a pro-ninja-master closer, has hundreds of closes at his or her disposal- as well as a complete commitment to creating fresh and innovative ways to handle any closing situation that arises. For example, if you take a look at Grant's book, The Closer's Survival Guide, you'll see that it contains over 120 closes. That's a good start. If you take our full-day Closing the Deal training, you'll get more than 200. Now, why do you need an arsenal? Because you need to have a close available for every scenario, so you know exactly what to say and when. In fact, do you know why most people fail during the close? Because they only have three, four, or five closes. That's just not enough variety to handle all the various types of customers you'll encounter, as well as the different objections they'll throw at you. I've heard it said that most prospects close after five attempts. In today's economy, I don't know if that's still true, but I do know this: A lot of salespeople don't even have five fluid closes at their disposal. That's why you want hundreds. That's what a master has, and they've practiced all of them enough so that they're fluid, natural, and easy to pull out at any time. You also have to commit yourself to fresh approaches. Have you ever heard a salesperson say: \u201cWhat do I have to do? What would it take? I want to earn your business.\u201d That's not going to get you anywhere and I'm not sure it even counts as a close. \u201cHow much time do you need to think about it?\u201d Or \u201cMake me an offer. If I could get that done, would you do it?\u201d Do you think any of those are effective? Maybe 50 years ago. But as we've discussed, selling has changed. Our closes need to change, too. Now as you're getting ready to master the art of closing, you need to start by understanding all the possibilities you'll encounter in the close. If you don't know the possibilities, you'll never come up with enough closes. After all, if you don't know how bad the hurricane can be, how can you prepare for it? What you'll want to do is write down every situation that you have ever experienced: \u201cThe payment is too high. The price is too high. I've got to think about it. I've got to talk to the board. I have to wait for my tax refund. I've got to look around more. I need management to approve it. I can get a better deal down the street. I need to come back another time. I want to wait for the economy to get better.\u201d As you write down all the things you hear during the close, here's what you're going to discover: There are a finite number of situations. This is good news, right? Because once you know every one of them, you can create a close that will handle them. This is something you'll want to work on in the next couple of days as you start to put into action the things you've learned today. But right now, I'm going to run through a few examples here to get you started. \u2022 \u201cI need to talk to my wife.\u201d By the way, you probably hear this a lot, so you're going to need a couple of closes to handle this one. Cardone Enterprises Close: \u201cI agree, and you should, but if your wife is anything like mine, she never tells me \u2018no' when I love something, and I never tell her \u2018no.' I need your approval here, here and here.\u201d \u2022 \u201cThe price is too high.\u201d Cardone Enterprises Close: \u201cI agree it's a lot of money, and I expect that you knew that before you got here. I need your OK here and here.\u201d \u2022 \u201cI need to think about it.\u201d Cardone Enterprises Close: \u201cI understand. However, you thinking about it will not change the fact that this product saves you money, your company needs it, and you are going to do it sooner or later. Let's get it done, so you can think about the other things that need attention. I need your approval here and here.\u201d Now once you have your lists of closes, what's your job? Drill them. Practice them, rehearse them, and enjoy them. And commit to mastering the art of the close. You showed up today, so I know you see the value in training like a pro. Apply that same mindset to the close, and you'll close more deals and make more money, guaranteed. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "The Secret to Success in Sales",
    "text": "The Secret to Success in Sales Now that we've explored all five steps of the Perfect Sales Process, we're going to start to wrap up today's training. But before we do that, I want to leave you with a final thought: Treat your success as your duty, obligation, and responsibility-not just as a job or even as a simple choice. Ask just about anyone whether they want to be successful, and they'll probably tell you \u201cyes.\u201d But most people only approach it as an option or a \u201cmaybe.\u201d If that's your approach, it almost always ensures that success will never be yours. Fewer than 2% of all households in America made more than $250,000 last year. Any guesses as to why that is? Is the whole system set up against 98% of the population? Or maybe a good number of those people are treating success as something that may or may not happen. The reality is that top salespeople and top earners are not smarter than you. And they probably don't work harder. The difference is that they commit to success, just like I asked you to commit to the Perfect Sales Process when we started this training today. Instead, they leave their success to chance, to the economy, to timing, or to any other happenstance that they have no control over. Whatever you want, you have to go at it with a relentless, undying, gotta-have-it kind of spirit. And the people in your life have to be on board. If you have a family, they need to be in agreement with your plan for the creation of success. Quit approaching success as an option, and your chances of reaching your dreams will rise exponentially. I can assure you that if you don't consider it your duty to live up to your potential, then you simply won't live up to it. If success doesn't become an obsession and a must, then you won't do what is necessary to attain it. Know this: Your journey will be filled with many unexpected obstacles. Those obstacles- and even other people-will attempt to stop you from reaching your destination. If you're committed to success as a destination, you'll simply last longer than everyone else, especially those who rely on luck. Luck is just one of the byproducts of those who take the most action and are the most prepared. The reason that successful salespeople seem lucky is because their success naturally allows for more success. Unless you are privy to the action, you don't see or hear about the number of times the top salespeople went for it and failed. Luck will not make you successful. Instead, committing yourself to success completely is the way to be lucky. You have to approach your sales success the way good parents approach their duty to their children: as an honor, an obligation, and a priority. Be committed to your career, your product, the company you work for, and to your client as a duty, obligation, and responsibility. That's why we started the day by making that most important sale to yourself. A good parent will do whatever it takes to care for his or her children: get up in the middle of the night, clothe, feed, and fight for them, take care of them, and even put their lives at risk to protect them. This is the same way you must approach your sales career. Now as you single mindedly pursue success, you will have setbacks. They're inevitable, especially when you're trying to master a new skill. If you truly want to get over these obstacles and emerge stronger on the other side, always be honest with yourself. Never justify failure. I see this a lot with people who are starting out in sales. When you aren't honest with yourself, you're basically giving up. Clearly, you aren't always going to make the sale. It's just the way sales works. What I don't want to see is one of you failing to make a sale, then spending the rest of the afternoon selling yourself lies and excuses about why it wasn't important or why you weren't successful. After every sales cycle, take a moment to be brutally honest with yourself. Ask yourself why you didn't get that sale. Ask what you could have done differently. Ask yourself things like: Where did I miss it? How could I have better justified the cost? Where could I have gotten them financing? Why didn't I get in front of the decision maker? I only asked for the order twice. Should I have asked again? Be 100% honest, and take complete responsibility for the outcome. Don't let your coworkers console you telling you that it's all right, the customer wasn't ready, they didn't have the money, they're cheap, they're a difficult group to sell, they never buy, they can't make decisions, our product price is too high, we don't have the right inventory, the economy sucks. Don't do it. Your sales success will come about as the result of your mental, spiritual, and technically prepared claim to create and own that success, followed by taking necessary actions that persist over time until you succeed in reaching your sales goals. If you are not able to be brutally honest with yourself about why you didn't make the sale, you will forever find your results dwindling. And when your success dwindles, you will see your actions start to do the same. In order to demand consistent sales success, you have to take full responsibility for every sale. Make success your duty, obligation, and responsibility. Take massive amounts of action followed by more action until the sale is made. Accept no excuses, reasons, or logic, and figure out how to make it work! That means preparing yourself daily to handle all the obstacles, stalls, reasons, and barriers you will encounter with a client."

    "text": "Who doesn’t want to feel good? Show me a person that doesn’t want to feel good and I’ll show you someone that you don’t want to bother selling! People want to feel good. People are moved by positive and confident people, more than by great products. There will always be a market for products that make people feel good, but a person who can make someone feel good can sell almost anything! The individual who combines a great attitude with a great product becomes unstoppable! The department, the division, and the company that can do the same—mix great people, great attitudes, and great products—are unstoppable. A positive attitude is a thousand times more important than the product you’re selling. I bet you know people like this: They'll spend a small amount of their income on the necessities and then blow their entire paycheck on entertainment. Season tickets to the Patriots. Trips to Mexico. A flat-screen TV with surround sound. Why? Because they want to feel good. It’s easy for buyers—your prospects—to say no to your product or no to the company, but it’s very difficult for them to say no to a positive experience with another human being. When something makes you feel good, you want more of it, whether it makes logical sense or not. It’s amazing how many salespeople are not clued in on this principle. The world is focused on chaos and bad news. 24/7, the media pounds negativity into the minds of anyone who will listen. Do you know how refreshing it is to finally meet someone who’s got a positive attitude, who’s uplifting and solution-oriented? At Cardone Enterprises, we have an assistant named Jen. When Grant first hired her, she had no experience with our business and had never worked in our industry. Grant didn’t hire Jen because of her abilities and experience, but because of her positive attitude. Jen is an upbeat “can-do,” get-it-done-with-a-smile-on-her-face kind of a person. That doesn’t mean she doesn’t make mistakes; she does. But because of her attitude, the mistakes are acceptable. When someone is so service-oriented, so positive, it’s impossible to imagine getting mad at her or ever letting her go. Is Jen selling? Absolutely! Every day, whether she knows it or not. When you are positive, people will find you irresistible. But this is something you have to work on because the world is filled with negativity. You’re pounded constantly, so this is another discipline we’re going to talk about creating next."

    "text": "Treat Them Like Millionaires Here's the deal. You want to be a millionaire? Treat everyone you meet like a millionaire. This is such an important point because it doesn't have anything to do with your product or your company. It's all about your attitude. People with money or people without money, treat them all like millionaires. People you think who will buy or think they won't buy, treat them like millionaires. The decision-makers or not the decision- makers, treat them like millionaires. Fifteen-year-olds or 50-year-olds, treat them like millionaires. Let's say you have a customer. Right now, he's broke, out of work, cannot get financing. How should you treat him? Treat him like a millionaire! Here's why: One day he's going to get back on his feet. And who do you think he's going to come to when he's in a position to buy? Yes, to the person who treated him with worth and respect, even when he didn't have a penny to his name. Now would this work in furniture? Would this work in electronics? Would this work on everything and anything that's ever sold? Sure, it would. Remember a price can be beaten, but a great attitude is priceless. How you act toward others will be how they'll act toward you. Your attitude precedes everything that happens to you in life. 3."

    "text": "Daily Attitude We talked earlier about how a great attitude is the key to your ability to sell, and your ability to have unlimited success. In this section, I want to dive into some specifics about what that great attitude looks like on a daily basis. Let's say you have a favorite restaurant and when you go, you valet park the car there, and this bleached-blond, spiky-haired guy always greets you, opens the car door, and smiles like he's glad to see you. \u201cGood to see you again, boss,\u201d he says. \u201cLeave it with me. I'll see you in a couple of hours and your car will be right up front.\u201d He gets a $20 tip from you every time, even though you know you could have parked the car yourself. Meanwhile, the other valet guy who works there greets you like you're a nuisance. Due to his poor attitude, you give him $5, and that's only because he actually did park your car. I'm sure he goes home and tells his girlfriend how cheap all the people who valet park their big cars are, and he's bitter and resentful that his spiky-haired partner just seems to be luckier than he is and gets the big tippers. But you and I-we know the truth! It's the attitude that makes the difference. As this example illustrates, your product can be replaced. But a great attitude cannot be replaced! A great attitude, great service, a great company... smiling, beaming, happy people cannot be replaced. Impossible. A price can be beaten; a great attitude is priceless. Imagine... what if your whole team was happy? What if everybody in your organization was happy and positive? Right now, you're probably thinking about specific people on your team or in your organization. \u201cJoe in service... Oh, he's negative. Marie in purchasing... she's negative. That person over there...\u201d If you're creating a list of negative people, you've got to fix YOUR attitude. Even when you have very negative people around you, if you continue to persist and be positive, you can expect sooner or later positive will win over. Think about it this way: If I scream and threaten another person, they're either going to flee (blow out of here because they're scared of me) or they're going to fight me. Neither response in a selling situation would be positive. But if I'm positive, if I'm agreeable, if I'm using phrases like, \u201cNo problem, I'll do that. I'd be happy to...\u201d, then I can expect sooner or later some of that negativity will start to melt away because it's contagious\u2013just like the flu. Right? Just like measles or chicken pox, any disease that is contagious can be caught by others, and so the same is true with positivity. This ability starts with you. It requires first a mental discipline, a muscle. Most of us have these internal narratives. And you're like, \u201cI can't do that. We can't do that. That can't be done. That can't happen. I hate myself. I'm going to quit.\u201d You've got to build and exercise that positivity muscle. You can't just walk around, \u201cAttitude is everything. Attitude is important. Okay, I'm going to have a positive attitude. I have to ACT positive...\u201d You need to drill it. Fill your attitude with positivity. It's contagious. TV, events, books, audio, everything positive. Not all TV is bad... there are good, inspiring programs. And now we have the ability to record just the TV programs we want to watch. Eliminate the rest. Remember, attitudes are contagious either way: the good, the bad, the ugly, and the positive. Attitudes are your number one tool. And it's the number one tool in your entire organization that will enable you to be sustainable and solvent. Your whole organization needs a great attitude. 4."

    "text": "Product of Your Environment If your parents are like most parents, at some point you heard, \u201cYou are who you hang out with.\u201d As an adult, maybe you heard it put this way: You are the average of the five people you surround yourself with. In this section we're going to break that down and show how you're not just a product of your environment, but a product of everything that SURROUNDS you. That includes the TV you watch, the newspapers you read, the friends you have, the movies you go to, your hobbies, your interests, your family, and everything else that you are involved with. All of it influences your environment. And the degree to which your environment is either healthy or unhealthy is going to have something to do with your ability to sell. The single most valuable asset you have in your life is your ability to stay positive when everyone else is losing their mind. When everyone around you is freaking out and worrying and singing the blues, you can choose to stay positive. By staying positive, you become the obvious leader, and people will follow your lead. It is not enough just to be positive; you have to actually protect yourself against those who are being negative. Watch out for friends, family, work associates, and others around you who have an agenda of negatively affecting those around them. Attitudes, like diseases, are contagious. So, here's the commitment you need to make: No negativity, ever, period. Make a commitment to keeping it out of your house, your office, your mind, and your life. You need to commit to it, because your life and your happiness depend on it, and your future prosperity and financial freedom depend on it. 5. Tips to a Great Attitude If you aren't getting paid the way you want to and you know what you're doing, I assure you that your attitude is part of your problem! So the question is, how do you change it? How do you stay positive? What can you do to ensure that you're smiling, happy, loving life, saying the right things? How can you keep that going, other than just drilling it and doing the reps? How do you keep it going when you go three, four, five days, or five weeks, or five months without a contract? Here's what you do: 1. Avoid newspapers, television, and radio. If you can't do it completely, cold turkey, commit to doing it for 30 days. If you can't do 30 days, hey, do one day. If you do it a whole month, you'll see dramatic results. 2. Stay away from \u201ccan't-do\u201d people. Stay away from people that have trouble in life, don't do well, arent't successful, aren't winning, and aren't lucky. Let's be clear: You can try to help the people, but you're not responsible for hanging out with them. This includes family and friends. 3. Create alignment. Get everyone in your life on the same page with where you're going and what you want in your life, as well as what's expected of them in order for you to get there! 4. Keep clean. Avoid drugs and alcohol because of the negative influence they have on your mind. They make you lethargic, slow, and unsure. Control your attitude by being aware and alert, not by being drugged and numbed. 5. Try to stay away from hospitals and doctors, if at all possible. This is a tip, you can take it, or you can leave it. Go see them only when you absolutely have to. Hospitals attract sick people. 6. Treat negative talk like garbage. Put up a sign in your home and your office that reads, \u201cNo negative talk zone.\u201d Don't allow people to talk negatively around you. 7. Start the Negativity Diet today. Commit to no negative thoughts, ideas, or talk for the next 24 hours. This will be a start to you really getting control of your thoughts and actions, and it will help you build discipline to control how you think and act. The Negativity Diet works like this: No negative thoughts, talk, or actions for a full 24 hours or you restart the clock. While this may seem like a very simple challenge, it's rare to make it through the first 24 hours without having to restart the clock. The power comes from the habit, and the habit comes one minute at a time. Just start over until you build a discipline to control for longer and longer periods of time. Make it a game and keep starting over as many times as you need to. When you commit to these changes and start paying attention, you're going to have a major wake-up moment. Once awake, a person will become aware and can start making changes. PART 2: THE MAGIC OF AGREEMENT In this section, we're going to continue on with the concept of attitude and apply it to the sales process. We're talking about the first rule of selling, and it's absolutely critical to understand. You may have picked up on it in the story of Grant and the gentleman who wanted to buy a truck, but didn't want to pay a penny over invoice. Here it is: The first rule of selling-no matter what your product, service, offer, or company- is this: Always, always, ALWAYS agree with the customer. Always! 1."

    "subsection_topic": "The First Rule of Selling",
    "text": "The First Rule of Selling Again, this is the single most important, most basic, and most commonly violated rule in all of selling; in fact, in all of communication. Write this down: If you want agreement, you have to be agreeable, okay? You can know the customer is wrong, and you would still need to agree with them. Right or wrong, agree. You can never expect someone to agree with you if you're disagreeing with them. Even if you're right, it won't happen. People are attracted to products, ideas, and people who represent the very things that they are already in agreement with. The people in your life you have the most agreement with are those people you want to spend the most time with. People who agree move toward one another. People who disagree move apart. Here's another commonly held truth we're debunking: Most people think it takes two people to resolve a conflict. Untrue. The truth is it takes one person to agree; and when they do, then there would be no conflict. Because for there to be conflict, there has to be two people disagreeing. Even when a buyer's making ridiculous, crazy claims or even exaggerations, agree. \u201cI'm with you, sir.\u201d \u201cI agree with you, ma'am.\u201d \u201cI understand.\u201d If they think something's black and you think it's white, you're both right. Now, I know you want to take your belief system and make them accept it. It's 100% clear that this is white. You're an expert, you've been doing this for years, and that is white, period. But the truth is it's black to them. If they think it's black and you want to get that sale, you need to see from their viewpoint how it could be black. If they think they should wait and think about it and you disagree, they'll dig in and become difficult. The objection will become valid and they will wait; and you will never get them to the close. The first rule of selling is always, always, always agree. Once you've agreed then you can move ahead. Agree, acknowledge, make the other party right for their thoughts, ideas, and beliefs, then close. No rule is violated more than the rule of agreement. It's unfortunate because agreeing is the road to more sales. You need to drill this, practice this, because humans are inclined-particularly in the West-to disagree in order to satisfy their need to be right. In selling you don't want to be right, you want to get something sold. 2."

    "text": "The Agreement Challenge The best way to start making this a habit is to do what is called the \u201cAgreement Challenge.\u201d It's going to sound really, really simple, but it's going to be harder than it sounds! The concept is simple: Practice handling other people with agreement first. Remember the first rule of selling? Always, always, always agree. So here's the drill. Try to agree with everyone-and I mean EVERYONE you talk to-for one 24-hour period. I know it sounds easy, right? But I guarantee you will not make three hours. If you find yourself disagreeing outwardly with someone, you have to start the drill over. Let's say you go to your kids \u201cHey, let's go to school.\u201d And your child says, \u201cI don't want to go to school today.\u201d If you're like most parents, you'll say, \u201cSon, put your clothes on, let's go.\u201d Whoops! You didn't agree with him first. You already messed up! So let's say your son says, \u201cI don't want to go to school today.\u201d Handle him by agreeing first. \u201cI understand, Son. When I was your age I didn't want to go to to school either. I hated school. Put your shoes on and let's roll out of here.\u201d Agree first and get the close later. Once you agree, it becomes possible for you to suggest other alternatives that are more suitable to you and your desires, but you have to get to agreement first. Let's do another example. Let's say you're doing this challenge. Let's say you sell solar roofing panels and the client tells you, \u201cHey that's way too much money.\u201d Now it's getting real. Agreeing now is going to cost you money, not just happiness, right? So, what are you going to say? Again, what you want to do is agree. You say, \u201cExcellent sir, and you know what? That's perfect for me. Everyone who invests in this product thinks it's a big investment. The truth is it IS a big investment; that's why you should get it installed now so you can start making your money back right away.\u201d Agree and then offer the buyer an opportunity to find his or her own solution before you start trying to stumble around and try to fix something that may not even be an issue. 3."

    "text": "The Agreement Drill Some people will say, \u201cAgreeing when you don't really agree is manipulation.\u201d Nope. I'm not manipulating anyone. Agreeing is an attempt to get along, not manipulation. Disagreeing with people manipulates me out of a sale, manipulates them out of a good product. And why? Because we're disagreeing, because I need to be right. If you need to be right, selling is gonna be very difficult for you. By establishing basic agreement, you are creating the opportunity to help the buyer purchase your product and service. If the buyer never gets a chance to see what you're offering because of earlier disagreements, then you've made an error by not allowing them to see your product, your service, your company, the value... because you got lost in disagreement. This is the vocabulary necessary to agree. Repeat after me: You're right! I'm with you! I agree! I''ll work it out! I understand! I'll make that happen! Done! This is your agreement vocabulary. You want to drill it until it becomes a muscle, until it becomes almost an automatic response. Start the relationship off with agreement. You'll have the chance later to tell the prospect, -your buyer-about your product, yourself, and your company. 4."

    "text": "Trust Is Critical to the Sale When you create trust, you will increase your effectiveness. Unfortunately, because of a handful of unethical salespeople who have misrepresented the benefits of their products, customers can sometimes not trust you. As a result, this skepticism keeps people on guard. It prevents the salesperson, you, from correctly establishing the trust critical to ever getting to a decision, and maybe even to selling your product, and showing the features and benefits. It doesn't matter where it came from. Distrust in a sales cycle is not the buyer's problem. Let me say that again: Distrust is not the buyer's problem. It's your problem. If the buyer doesn't trust you or your company or what you're saying, or your presentation, then the information you're offering will be minimized, challenged, comparison shopped, maybe even thrown in the trash. Let's be clear: The buyers will make a decision. If they buy from you, that's a decision. If they buy from a competitor, that's a decision. When they leave and don't do anything, that is a decision. When the buyer decides to think about it, to put it off, that's a decision. It's just not always the decision you want. When your buyer shops around, or thinks more, or puts off the purchase, it's because of some level of distrust. After all, if the buyers had full and complete confidence in you, the product, the terms, the company, they would commit and they'd do it now. When a salesperson understands what is going on in the mind of the customer, you've stepped into the area that only the professional delves into. This goes beyond selling now. This is beyond what the customer is saying or communicating. And when you do that, you know when people don't trust you. What I want you to get right now is this: 1. Trust is critical. I know you know that. Trust is critical. You need to hear this over and over. Trust is everything in sales. 2. If you don't get the sale, something is not trusted. This is absolute. If you don't get the sale, you're not trusted. Something's not trusted. 3. Every decision is a decision. You've got to build trust. 5. Customers Don't Make Sales, Salespeople Do You and your organization are going to make or break the sale. Customers don't stop sales, salespeople stop sales. In order to make sales, you have to understand the mind of a customer. If you don't recognize how buyers think, what causes them to respond, what causes them to act, you'll never be able to take full responsibility and you will never truly reach your potential. People are run by their minds. Understand the mind and you understand people. If people don't buy, it's because at some point you didn't assume enough responsibility for the selling, and didn't assume enough responsibility for the buying, either. You have to take responsibility for both, not one or the other. When you're at the top of your game, you'll take responsibility for managing the entire transaction. You'll take responsibility for getting the financing and it's not even your job. You'll take responsibility for the executive level decisions, if it's necessary, in order for you to get the job done. What I'm saying to you is this: Don't think about just your role. Think about getting the job done, whatever it takes. You have to get people confident in you. You can't get that disagreeing. You can't get it arguing. You cannot get it by insisting they do certain things. We have to build trust. It's your job not just to sell your product, but to help them buy the product. Take responsibility for both roles and you'll see your trust go up. That's why the only thing the buyer should have to do when they come to your company or when you assist them-the only thing they should have to do-is give you money. That's their job. 6. Credibility = Increased Sales A person could trust you and you could actually lose credibility. I'll give an example that happens all the time in the auto business. Running back and forth to someone to check with. \u201cI gotta go check with Barbara. I gotta go check with John. I gotta go check with somebody else.\u201d When you say you have to check with someone else, it's like you're saying, \u201cI'm not sure. I don't know. I can't tell you that,\u201d and that causes credibility issues. When something happens that puts your credibility into question-maybe you misquote something, you give the wrong information, you say something that's not true and the customer checks on the internet and finds out it's not accurate-you lose your credibility. Then it becomes difficult for the buyer to trust you to guide them. Someone can trust you, but not find you credible because they're simply not confident in you. Ignoring the credibility issue will not make the problem disappear. It has to be handled. When the buyer doesn't trust, you're not getting a sale. When the buyer doesn't have credibility or believe in you, you're probably not going to get the sale, either. If you want to work on credibility, it means you need to know everything there is to know about your field. You need to know about people, your products, your competition. You have to be credible. You can't be running around saying, \u201cOh, I don't know, let me ask Joe.\u201d Let's say you're looking to buy some property in Los Angeles. You do your research about the houses in Los Angeles, the square footage, the price per square foot, what's available, what's not. You look at more homes in your particular price range than the real estate agent has. She's going to lose credibility with you. You may trust her as a person, but she loses credibility, which means she lengthens the sales process. She makes herself less valuable to you, and then you start shopping other realtors. It's just how it works. You want a salesperson who is an expert, who has credibility. When you're a salesperson, you want to own that credibility. That's the skill that you will need no matter what you do, where you go, what you present, whether you own the company, or you're the janitor. You need credibility. 7."

    "text": "People Believe What They See, Not What They Hear Have you ever had a customer who was just not listening to you? You're talking, \u201cDah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,\u201d and it's not landing with them. This phenomenon occurs because the buyer assumes they can't trust you. He assumes that you're just talking. He assumes you're a pitchman, that you'll say anything. What it comes down to is people don't believe what they hear, people believe what they see. People will take the written word from a newspaper and even though it's false, they buy it. Because it was written, so it must be true. So, if people believe the written word-which they do-then always have your presentation, your proposals, your prices, your information, the data you're sharing, always have it in writing for the buyers, so they can see it with their own eyes. It's going to make you more believable, get more trust, and make you more credible. When people see it in writing, it becomes real to them. Use data and evidence to back up what you're saying. That way it makes you credible and shows that they can trust you. Make this a rule that you sell by. Assume that you must show them written data to support what you're saying. Buyers are usually drawing off of their own experiences of fabrications. They've fabricated, they've exaggerated. So, when you start pitching, they have to assume that viewpoint of distrust, because they've done that themselves. This isn't about you and your integrity. It isn't about your honesty or your intentions. You would never ever exaggerate, you would never over-offer, you would never over promise, never. This has nothing to do with what we're talking about. We're talking about them and their distrust, and what's going on inside them. Your job is to be credible and trustworthy to the customer you're in front of. When a customer has misunderstandings, this leads to distrust. So, what are you going to do to build credibility? Put it all in writing. Make a list of the things you can show or support what you're telling your customer. Then you can use that written material to validate and make yourself more credible. 8."

    "subsection_topic": "Use Third-Party Data to Validate",
    "text": "Use Third-Party Data to Validate So now you know how to build credibility and counter buyer distrust by using the written word. Now, let's take that a step further. When you're documenting facts for your customer, it's preferable to use third-party materials rather than something from you. You know how this goes... if The New York Times or even just Bob the blogger writes something about this product, that's more believable than if I said it myself. If my manufacturer said it and that was supported by some other third parties, that would be more acceptable to the consumer. That's third-party validation. Let's review: 1. When you're presenting features and benefits of your product, you're going to either write them down or show the benefits on paper, and support that with third-party validation. 2. If you're showing your customers how your product will improve their business, show them proof: statistics, success stories, in writing. 3. You want to keep an evidence manual of facts, success stories, and what other people have said as a result of doing business with you. 4. When you show them what your competition will do or won't do and you get in this bidding war, show them in writing. When you know you have the best price, you have the best product, you have the best service, back it up with documentation. All these things will increase your odds at closing the sale. People believe the written word and you want to capitalize on that. With the abundance of information available to today's buyer and to you through third-party consumer guides, the internet, and other sources, the buyers have become even more dependent upon facts to support their decisions. Buyers are going to continue to rely on these sources, so you need to make use of them as well. Those same sources will support your cause, build trust, and help the buyer trust you, so that they can trust themselves enough to make a right decision, and make it now. Also, know that an informed buyer is always better than an uninformed buyer. Here's why: An uninformed buyer cannot make a decision. This is a misconception in selling. Most salespeople would rather sell somebody not knowledgeable, because they think it's easier to sell them if they're uninformed. Someone who is uninformed about the product will make an offer that will almost always be too low; that's because it would be an emotional offer, not a logical one. We want logic and facts in the close, right? That's why we want to keep things credible. How do I keep things credible? I keep people logical. How do I keep people logical? Providing them with good data, providing them with the information. Information builds credibility, credibility builds trust, and trust means a buyer can make a decision. 9."

    "text": "Tips on Using Information to Build Trust Now I want to review some very specific tips on information to build trust. First, never sell with only words. Make sure to show documentation. I know I'm pounding this in, but trust is vital to a sale. Second, never negotiate with words. Instead, write your negotiations down on paper. Third, never ask for the close with words only. Use a buyer's order. Close with a written document. Fourth, never make verbal promises. If there is a guarantee, a warranty, some promise, put it in writing, otherwise the buyer is not going to trust it. Fifth, the more data, the better. Don't be afraid to use lots of data. Sixth, keep your information current. Something from a year ago means nothing to the person today. Seventh, have your written information available and easy to access, even prebuilt on your website. Eighth, use third-party data as much as possible. Third-party references, other sources; credible sources other than yourself. Ninth, the more you're able to access data in real time, the better. Prepared packages aren't bad, but if a customer could look on the internet with you in real time, that's preferred. Tenth, use computer-generated data whenever possible. Have internet access available to you right in the moment in front of the customers, so that they can see it's not contrived, it's not manipulated, and they can trust it. Make it easy for the buyer to research while they're with you. Remember, if they have enough information, it'll build trust and they can make a decision. After consulting hundreds of companies on improving sales processes, Cardone Enterprises often encourages the business management and the salespeople to make all competitive advertising available and fully displayed in their offices, so that the buyer doesn't have to go out and look at competition. Why have your clients do the work and shop around? Get set up to build credibility and you will see people make decisions with you now, when they used to be making decisions with you later. PART 3: GIVE, GIVE, GIVE In this segment, we're going to talk about the importance of serving and giving, and how when you get your priorities right, the sale is easy. Does this sound good? Let's dive in. 1."

    "text": "The Magic of Give, Give, Give Selling is the act of giving. And in all these previous segments that I've been talking about the basics of selling, I'm talking about service, not just selling. Look, it's not just about getting people sold, it's about servicing them to the sale. The true essence of selling is not just getting the sale. I mean real professional, master league greatness in selling is predicated on a sincere desire to help, to aid, to assist in service. The best salespeople I've ever met operate from this high plane of service. This is something that Grant has validated in his own life, and he's also seen it validated by the way other people live their lives-that if you give enough, life will sooner or later give back to you. And this is true for everyone. It's the same in sales as it is in life. I'm talking about giving the most attention. I'm talking about giving people the most energy you have. Giving them the best attitude, the highest level of service. Give, give, give. The focus is on how I can give people more, not just sell them more. This is the assurance of more sales, and more sales, and more sales. It starts with give, give, give. Grant lives this every day. If a customer asked him, \u201cHey Grant, can you get me something to drink?\u201d Grant would get it for him. He'd open the bottle, he'd bring him a glass, he'd bring him ice, and he'd bring him a napkin. That's the way to service people. The guy didn't ask for ice, he didn't ask for a glass, and he didn't ask for the napkin. He didn't ask for it to be brought on a tray, but that's what you want to do. You want to deliver beyond what they ask for. That's give, give, give in action. Give all of you-not part of you-to your customer. If you go into a transaction and you think, \u201cThere's no way I'm going to make a deal, I'm only going to give the guy 25%.\u201d There is no way you're going to make a deal at 25%. Give all your attention, all your energy, all your suggestions, all your information, then find some more of you to give. Exceed the buyers' expectations. Go further than they would ever expect you to. Withhold nothing and give yourself without reservation. 2. Love the One You're With When it comes to selling, you always want to pay attention to the one you're with. Stay with them from start to finish without allowing interruptions. While I'm here with you today, I'm not answering texts or phone calls. Imagine I did right now in the middle of our time together. What would you say? You'd be thinking, \u201cHow unprofessional is that? The guy's off doing other stuff while we're here waiting!\u201d Show your customer how they're the most important person in your universe. Love the one you're with. If you can do that, you will be rewarded. But you have to give all of you, 100% of you. No taking a phone call or sending out an email. Just be focused on what's in front of you. You want to make your total commitment to that one opportunity, that one customer. Your customers will see that you're there with them all the way, regardless if they are taking calls, being distracted, or being interrupted. Human beings are more valuable than money. I don't care if they have money or don't have money. Treat them like they will buy and they'll buy. Remember when we talked about treating people like millionaires? Once you get that discipline built in, people are going to pick up on it. The best salespeople in the world are not fast-talking people. Instead, they're the ones who go the extra mile to find ways to improve the customer's life, who find ways to pay complete attention, even if they're working with five people at the same time. Whether it's one customer or five, love the one you're with. You've got enough attention to go around to a lot of places, more than you're using. What I want you to practice right now is giving complete attention to one at a time, until you're good enough to spread it out among everyone. Love the one you're with. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "Level of Service",
    "text": "Level of Service Service is the way to higher profits, higher prices, and the only way to lessen the competition. You can literally separate yourself from the entire pack of competition with just one item: high levels of service. A salesperson caught in a constant price conflict might not agree with my points here because they're mentally stuck in the concept that price is the only solution, the only way out. But price is not a solution; it is never the way out and it will never be. A better product is not the solution, either. Sooner or later, someone is going to copy your product, make something similar-or even better-that they're willing to sell at a lower price. So what will buyers pay extra for? The product? I don't think so. I think they're going to pay extra for great service. And even if you have a great product, somebody's going to copy it sooner or later, and then it's going to be back to price again. For instance, Apple was killing it in the marketplace for a long time with products people loved. Now, there are arguably better products out there. But no one does a better job at servicing them. You just pop into the Apple Store and get a genius-and who doesn't want a genius to help you? As long as they're tops in service, they're going to stay on top, even if other people come up with better products. The ease of purchase is the way to service somebody. Convenience is the way to service someone. It's not just about a cheaper price. People will pay more for great service than they will for a great product. So, how can you create a level of service that separates you from others and that people will pay for? What's your equivalent of a Genius Bar? For instance, going to the client rather than the client coming to you is a great service. I don't know why more businesses don't do this! Creative thinking, creative action. Go where other people won't go. That's what you want to do with service. At Cardone Enterprises, we actually think creatively about what our competition won't do, because that's where we want to go. There's no value in us dropping our prices. People brag when they pay extra to do business at Tiffany's, the Ritz, the Four Seasons. People pay $2,500 a year to own the Black Card, to get the Express Centurion service from American Express. Elevate your service to that Black Card level. Elevate your level of service to rival that of the Four Seasons. I don't want you to be competing with your competitor. I want you to get way above them. Put your customer in a level of service where they don't comparison-shop you. They don't mention price. They're just like, \u201cOkay, let's do it because I know you're going to take care of me.\u201d There are a lot of sales trainers out there who will tell you that you should never call back a client and ask for a problem. I've heard this advice before: \u201cDon't ask for problems.\u201d And salespeople believe this! But I'll tell you the truth: You WANT problems. Problems are opportunities. At Cardone Enterprises, there's a policy that all complaints go straight to Grant. He wants the complaints because he knows these are opportunities for him to offer service and to separate us from everyone else. Adopt an attitude that reflects that problems aren't the service department's responsibility or the call center's responsibility. If a customer has a problem, you want to take care of it. This gives you an opportunity to have a relationship, to own that client. Service is senior to selling. Look for every opportunity possible to service your client. 4."

    "text": "Make Service Senior to Selling Service is always senior to selling someone. Grant says one of the best salespeople that he has ever met is a guy named Gavin, who is a fundraiser. Grant considers Gavin a friend because of the amount of attention Gavin gives Grant not just when he wants something, but the rest of the time, too. He is always asking, \u201cHow can I help you Grant, what can I do to help your organization, what can I do to help you, is there any way I can be of service?\u201d Gavin is an incredible salesperson. But above that, he is dedicated to high levels of service, he is dedicated to human beings, and he is dedicated and interested in helping people. Maybe Gavin is just a complete manipulator and doesn't mean any of that; but that is not true because he is so consistent in offering service. His commitment to service and to raising funds is deep. His dedication to high levels of service and to those individuals that actually contribute is even deeper. One without the other generates mediocre results. You have to have them both: Deep belief in your product and a high level of service. You put those two together... This guy Gavin is going around with barrels loaded: service and purpose. In all these segments for this training, we're not just talking to you about teaching you how to sell. We are teaching you a mindset, a new discipline, a new way of being, so you can be successful at whatever you want to do. You'll experience a career that is free of stress, worry, and problems. Give yourself fully and provide unparalleled levels of service. Forget about the competition. Exceed what they do. 5."

Most people aren't going to say \u201cyes\u201d if you quit. They're not going to just say \u201cokay\u201d all of the sudden. If you quit, it's going to be a \u201cno.\u201d It's been my experience that most people won't just give you the money without you asking and persisting, and being willing to do what we call a \u201cHard Sell.\u201d I don't mean they're a hard sell. They're not hard to sell. You are a hard sell. Let me be clear: I'm not talking about pressuring people. If I have a great product, a great service, and I know it will save the people money, and I know it's the right thing to do, trust me, I will stay there until I get the deal. I'm talking about being willing to get to that hard place in the close where everyone may experience a bit of discomfort. The salesperson, you, the manager, the CEO, or anybody who wants to make anything happen in their life must be willing to stay in a transaction and persist through that transaction to the close, if they truly believe deep down inside that the product or the service is right for the buyer. If you don't stay in it, if you don't persist, it's not going to happen. A buyer may say to you, \u201cHey, are you pressuring me right now?\u201d That's when you answer, \u201cSir, you're confusing my belief, and my passion, and my insistence on knowing that this is the right thing, that this is the right product, that we're the right company, that I'm the right person. Please don't confuse that with pressure. Don't misinterpret my enthusiasm for pressure. Let's do this.\u201d When you hit this place called the \u201cHard-Sell Status,\u201d you've become so convinced in your product, in your company, in your service, that the only answer that truly takes care of this buyer now is to close. In fact, it would be a disservice if you don't close. Because you believe so deeply, you're willing to stay in this deal even when it gets uncomfortable. The willingness to stay in there is what separates the professional, the master of the trade, from an amateur. 6."

    "text": "Closing Is Like a Recipe If you're making a meal, you're going to open a book or pull up a recipe online. You're going to say, \u201cHey, what's in the recipe? What do I put? What are my ingredients?\u201d Combine those specific ingredients together in a certain order, put them in the oven at a certain temperature for a certain amount of time, do it exactly as the recipe is laid out, and you get what you anticipated. But if you change one thing, the recipe changes. It's the same thing with closing. The more you practice handling objections, handling people's stalls, handling things that aren't even objections which are more often just complaints, the more natural you're going to sound. Let me be clear, there's nothing wrong with you learning what you're going to say. You want to know what you're going to say, so that you can handle certain situations successfully. And that means practicing. You need to practice handling objections, stalls, and complaints, so that you can persist intelligently through the resistance. Grant talks about how he practiced this daily for years. Each day on his way to work he listened to material that prepared him for the close. Every morning after he got to work, he'd team up with another salesperson or a manager, and they'd practice every possible situation that they would possibly encounter that day. You can do this too. If you don't learn how to do that, you're not going to become one of the greats. Know how to make the recipe, know how to deliver it, know how to cook it, and know how to close it. Video yourself. Literally, get a video camera or use your phone. Watch your gestures. Watch your hand motions. Watch your tone level. Watch the responses. Throughout the day write down those objections, and then the next day team up with another associate. Practice handling anything you weren't satisfied with from the day before. Drill, practice. This is what builds confidence. PART 4: THE PRICE MYTH You're going to love this section. We're getting into the nitty-gritty of sales, the stuff you've been thinking about... money. We're going to talk about price, dealing with price objections, and what's really holding your buyers back from buying-and it's usually not money! 1. It's Almost Never Price Now, if I were to survey all the salespeople in the world, which is about 1.25 billion people, most of them would say that the number-one reason they lose a sale is over price. And 1.25 billion people would be absolutely incorrect. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Price is not the buyer's biggest concern. It is actually at the bottom of the list of concerns and reasons why people don't buy. Most sales are lost over objections you never ever hear. Getting the sale is not about money. It's ultimately about the buyer: Your buyer having confidence, first, in that the product is the right one; second, that you're the right person; and third, that he or she wants this company supporting him or her. But here's the catch: Your buyers are never going to tell you, \u201cYou know, I'm really concerned I'm not making the right decision on the right product.\u201d Instead, they are going to talk about the price. Most salespeople believe that if the price was just a little lower they'd sell more of it. But the truth is, I promise you, you would not sell more because you haven't correctly named the right problem. And if you don't name the right problem, you're never going to be able to come up with the right answer. Price is not the problem. Do the buyers love the product? Do they have complete confidence that this product is right? Do they have complete confidence that the company will take care of them? Do they have complete confidence that you will support them? And do they value that product, the company, and you enough that they'd pay for it? It takes an individual-a human being, a salesperson-to sell features, benefits, to build value, to do a great product presentation, to get emotional, and get the customer emotional, so that the customer can even make sense of the price! You have to give the buyers reasons to build that value in their own mind. Logical reasons so they can justify first, making a decision; second, making sense of the money. And which one is more important? Making a decision. It is not your job to make sense of the money, it's your job to give the buyer an emotional connection, a heartfelt connection, to make a decision that is logical. A logical reason to justify a heart decision. You sell people emotionally, you close them with logic. You do this with words and phrases, which we'll talk about more. But right now, I need you to understand one basic idea-and I don't care if you've been doing this 50 years or 50 minutes-price is not the problem. 2."

    "subsection_topic": "Love, Solve Problems, and Confidence",
    "text": "Love, Solve Problems, and Confidence When you have a price conflict, there is something you don't know about what people value. And if you don't know what they value, you cannot provide information for them to make sense of the price. You have to know what else is important to these people other than price. These days, it's easy to shop around based on price. Your buyer can always find someone that will sell that product cheaper. So if that's true, if everyone has access to a database of who's charging what, explain to me why everyone doesn't just buy from the lowest seller. It is because people want more than the lowest price. People want to know \u201cI'm buying the right thing.\u201d \u201cI have confidence in the product, I have confidence not just in the product, but in the company that's getting it to me.\u201d \u201cI have confidence in the product, in the company, and in the person who's representing that company.\u201d And that's you. So, what do you do? First, establish that they love the product. Number one, love it, love it, love it-heart beating, stammering, gotta have it. Number two, they have confidence that you'll solve their problem. Number three, you need to demonstrate why buying from you and your company is uniquely different. It's a value-added proposition, you offer something others do not offer. Let's say a guy is buying a three-carat ring for his girlfriend. He is trying to solve a problem, trust me. Before, or just after you present your product, determine the connection or love, the affinity they have with this product by presenting other possibilities. You could say, \u201cHey, any chance you'd consider this?\u201d \u201cNo no no no, this is the one I want.\u201d \u201cHow about this? How about we go over here?\u201d \u201cNo no no, this is the one I want.\u201d If you hear that, you have found out you have a connection. Now let's talk about the second point, confidence in the product and solving problems. Every customer, 100% of the time, is looking to solve a problem when they are buying a product, always. This means you first find out the connection, and then you find out what problem they're trying to solve. What is the primary motivation? Why did you come in today? Why now? Why are you considering doing this at this time? Why didn't you do it three months ago? Why didn't you wait for three months? You have to probe to find out what the motivation is. \u201cWell, I'm really trying to buy a ring for my girl because we broke up.\u201d Oh, they broke up! That means he is trying to get her back. He'll go three carats, he might go four. Once you have the connection, once you know what the real problem is, now the third point is you and the company. Make people like you. Service them like mad, like crazy, laugh with them, agree with them, have a great attitude. When they're in love and completely confident in the product solving their problems, and then, on top of that they like you, want to do business with you, and see value in you, you got your deal. But those three things have to be in. Then price isn't an issue. It never was. 3."

    "subsection_topic": "More on Price",
    "text": "More on Price We're not done with price yet! I really want you to understand the price issue because it stumps so many salespeople. Have you ever bought a piece of clothing that was cheap, really inexpensive, but you only bought it because of the price? Then you went home and found out it doesn't fit-it doesn't look good on you, so you never wore it. It's still in your closet four years later. Was it a good deal? No, because it was a waste. Now you understand that price is not the only issue. You have to get your buyers to want something-your product-more than they want their money. If I'm selling a $40,000 product and a guy says, \u201cI'll do it. Let's roll. I want it. I'll take it. Let's get it.\u201d He believes that product is worth more than $40,000, otherwise he wouldn't close the deal. To get to the level where the value of the product exceeds the value of your client's money, you have to discover what they're trying to accomplish. You will then know what your product is worth. Then you'll be able to demonstrate to him or her how your product solves that problem. This is the essence of how to close a deal. So again, if you build the value high enough, the clients will come up with the money. If they really love it, if it really solves a problem, they'll figure out a way to do the deal. If they're absolute in love and confident it will solve their problems, they'll give up their money. Whether you're selling a $40,000 product, a $4 million product, or a $400 million product, it doesn't matter. You need to know that whatever that price point is, you have to do a presentation, a demonstration, and build way greater value than the money you're asking for. 4. Handling \u201cOther\u201d Concerns Handles Price Now I want to talk about how dealing with other concerns can actually handle price. I know that if the person I'm working with can afford- meaning, he or she has the funds available to buy my product or service- but is not buying my product or service and continues to harp and focus on the money, I always realize that this buyer has some other concerns. So while your customer may be objecting to price, the budget, or the terms, there's something else that you possibly don't know. So let's run through what those might be: Is this the right product? They're wondering, is there a better product than this product for us? Is this the right proposal? The terms, the payments, the interest rate, the other parts of the proposal. Will this truly solve our problem? This is a big concern for people today. Will my people use it? Will I use it? What will other people think about me doing this? People buy stuff everyday. They won't even tell anybody because they're ashamed of what they bought. Is this something I'm going to really use and enjoy? Or is it going to just sit in the closet and never be used? Will this company really take care of us and service us? The last two companies didn't. Are they going to be different? Am I better off buying some other product? Most of you right now think that you're in competition with another person who sells exactly the same product you sell. This is incorrect. You are in competition today with the entire world and everything that is being sold. For instance, I could buy a $60,000 car or I could take that money and buy a golf membership. I'm going to do one or the other. That's why I say you're competing with the country club now, not just other car dealerships. Will something better come out next week? In the technology world, this happens all the time. Do I want to hold off on this computer purchase for three months? Do I know enough to make a decision? Do I need more data? Do I need to do more shopping? Do I have all the information? Should we get invested, or should we get our money invested in something else instead of this? Is this going to be a mistake like other decisions I've made? Is this person going to let me down? Will this person even be here three months from now to help me and service me? If these considerations are handled to your buyer's satisfaction, price will not be the biggest issue. 5. Justifying Price with Other Inventory When faced with a price objection, salespeople-and managers-often make the mistake of always offering something for a lower price. But this is incorrect. If you do this, you are supporting the solution on the false belief that price is the only reason people don't buy things. When you move the customers down in price to offer something cheaper, they are actually even less likely to want the next product if they didn't want the first one. This will cause your buyer to actually believe that you don't have a solution, and that he or she is just wasting time. What you want to do instead is to actually move the buyer up, when a price objection comes up. This will get your customer thinking in terms of value, not price, and will determine whether or not the price objection is even valid. Let's say someone's looking at diamond rings. He's not 100% set on the first ring you show him. You offer to show him something more expensive. Either he agrees to look at something more expensive or he doesn't. If he says, \u201cI can't look at it, I really like this one,\u201d that means he's committed. If he says, \u201cI'll look at the more expensive ring,\u201d that means he wasn't committed. If he tells you he needs to move in the other direction, something cheaper, then price was a valid objection. If price is a valid objection, we can move him down in inventory. That's what happens when he looks at the more expensive options. It actually builds value on what you were originally showing him. He can't afford the higher-priced items, but either way you've got him shopping your inventory. When you can't close a sale because of money, you always want to think, first thing, I need to move them up. This is called \u201cclosing with inventory.\u201d You are using inventory to close. You are exhausting inventory, not your gross margin. I've had thousands of customers telling me \u201cit's too much money, I'm over budget.\u201d They get all uncomfortable and freak out about the money like it's the security of their lifetime. When they get that look on their face, I immediately move the buyer up to a more expensive product. Why? Because he or she is telling me it's too much money for that product. It's too much money for that service. It didn't resolve the problem. You've got to believe that your buyer would rather pay more and make the right decision than pay less and make a mistake. Your problem with the sale is the decision, not the price. Don't buy into the talk, into the gossip, the rumor of the other mediocre salespeople around you who believe price is the big issue and price is the most important thing. You hear it all the time, \u201cIf I could sell for less, I'd sell more.\u201d These people promote this idea so freely. They sell because they believe that if price was lower they'd sell more. It's simply not true. It's not true. You cannot be Walmart. I'll give you an example. One time a charity asked Grant to help them out with some fundraising. They told him about this one qualified prospect they'd been working with. \u201cThis guy is tough, Grant. We've been working on it for a year and he won't give us any money.\u201d In three minutes, Grant took this guy up 10 times the amount they were asking him to contribute. It was 10,000 and Grant moved him to 100,000. Afterwards, Grant asked him, \u201cWhy did you give me 100 and you wouldn't give them 10?\u201d The guy said, \u201cGrant, I didn't think 10,000 would make a difference.\u201d They weren't using the right order of magnitude. They weren't using a number big enough to solve his problem. Remember, when it's too much money, what are you going to do? Move them up first. This is a great technique. I promise you, you'll close more sales and make more money. 6. Salespeople Stop Sales, Customers Don't We've been talking a lot about how you have responsibility for the sale. Let's hammer that home even more. Here's the deal: Salespeople stop sales. Customers do not stop them. Have you ever noticed that salespeople have this incredible ability to place blame on a number of factors when they are unable to sell their products? They blame customers. They blame the market. They blame the management. They blame the economy. They blame the manufacturer. They blame the government, the last government, the next government, 20 years from now, and on, and on. It's called \u201cblame management.\u201d Don't allow yourself this habit. When you're not able to close a deal- make the sale- ask yourself: What did I not do? What did I miss? What did I not uncover? You can even ask these questions directly to the customer. Grant always says that when a customer tells him, \u201cHey, I'm not buying today.\u201d Grant replies, \u201cSir that would be my fault, not yours. I take full responsibility for your decision.\u201d When he does this, even very seasoned professional-buyer types look at him and say, \u201cHey, that's good. I've never heard that from a salesperson before.\u201d More often than not, within 60 minutes, the deal, the transaction is finished. Take responsibility for everything. You will then make the sale. Make this part of your presentation. For instance, if the price isn't right, it's your fault. If the timing's not right for them, it's your job to make it right. If the customer doesn't have enough information, it's your responsibility to get them the right information. If financing for some reason became a problem, that would be your job to handle, not theirs. Basically, if anything is a problem, you will be the one to solve it. That's your job. If you can't solve it, hey, the customer sure doesn't have to. Write it down: Never, never, never again will I blame a customer for not making a decision. If it is to be, it's up to me.

If he says, “I can’t look at it, I really like this one,” that means he’s committed. If he says, “I’ll look at the more expensive ring,” that means he wasn’t committed. If he tells you he needs to move in the other direction, something cheaper, then price was a valid objection. If price is a valid objection, we can move him down in inventory. That’s what happens when he looks at the more expensive options. It actually builds value on what you were originally showing him. He can’t afford the higher-priced items, but either way you’ve got him shopping your inventory. When you can’t close a sale because of money, you always want to think, first thing, I need to move them up. This is called “closing with inventory.” You are using inventory to close. You are exhausting inventory, not your gross margin. I’ve had thousands of customers telling me “it’s too much money, I’m over budget.” They get all uncomfortable and freak out about the money like it’s the security of their lifetime. When they get that look on their face, I immediately move the buyer up to a more expensive product. Why? Because he or she is telling me it’s too much money for that product. It’s too much money for that service. It didn’t resolve the problem. You’ve got to believe that your buyer would rather pay more and make the right decision than pay less and make a mistake. Your problem with the sale is the decision, not the price. Don’t buy into the talk, into the gossip, the rumor of the other mediocre salespeople around you who believe price is the big issue and price is the most important thing. You hear it all the time, “If I could sell for less, I’d sell more.” These people promote this idea so freely. They sell because they believe that if price was lower they’d sell more. It’s simply not true. It’s not true. You cannot be Walmart. I’ll give you an example. One time a charity asked Grant to help them out with some fundraising. They told him about this one qualified prospect they’d been working with. “This guy is tough, Grant. We’ve been working on it for a year and he won’t give us any money.” In three minutes, Grant took this guy up 10 times the amount they were asking him to contribute. It was 10,000 and Grant moved him to 100,000. Afterwards, Grant asked him, “Why did you give me 100 and you wouldn’t give them 10?” The guy said, “Grant, I didn’t think 10,000 would make a difference.” They weren’t using the right order of magnitude. They weren’t using a number big enough to solve his problem. Remember, when it’s too much money, what are you going to do? Move them up first. This is a great technique. I promise you, you’ll close more sales and make more money."

    "text": "We’ve been talking a lot about how you have responsibility for the sale. Let’s hammer that home even more. Here’s the deal: Salespeople stop sales. Customers do not stop them. Have you ever noticed that salespeople have this incredible ability to place blame on a number of factors when they are unable to sell their products? They blame customers. They blame the market. They blame the management. They blame the economy. They blame the manufacturer. They blame the government, the last government, the next government, 20 years from now, and on, and on. It’s called “blame management.” Don’t allow yourself this habit. When you’re not able to close a deal—make the sale—ask yourself: What did I not do? What did I miss? What did I not uncover? You can even ask these questions directly to the customer. Grant always says that when a customer tells him, “Hey, I’m not buying today.” Grant replies, “Sir that would be my fault, not yours. I take full responsibility for your decision.” When he does this, even very seasoned professional-buyer types look at him and say, “Hey, that’s good. I’ve never heard that from a salesperson before.” More often than not, within 60 minutes, the deal, the transaction is finished. Take responsibility for everything. You will then make the sale. Make this part of your presentation. For instance, if the price isn’t right, it’s your fault. If the timing’s not right for them, it’s your job to make it right. If the customer doesn’t have enough information, it’s your responsibility to get them the right information. If financing for some reason became a problem, that would be your job to handle, not theirs. Basically, if anything is a problem, you will be the one to solve it. That’s your job. If you can’t solve it, hey, the customer sure doesn’t have to. Write it down: Never, never, never again will I blame a customer for not making a decision. If it is to be, it’s up to me."

    "text": "No Shortage of Money If you're going to make big money, you need to get your head right about money. Before you ever ask a customer for money-and I'm talking to management now, I'm talking to salespeople, I'm talking about anybody who wants to get more money-you have to get yourself straight about the subject. Did you know there's enough money circulating on this planet right now for every human being to have a multimillion-dollar net worth? Isn't that a great idea? Now, I'm not saying that somebody's just going to give you the money. You're going to have to go get your share. If you're not getting your share it's because you're thinking in terms of hard work and limits, not abundance. Imagine I sent you to the Red Sea right now and I told you to get as many buckets of water as you want. How many can you take? Look, you could take as many buckets as you want, nobody's going to know anything happened, because there's plenty of ocean water. Same thing with money. Look how much money there is in the marketplace, how many homes, cars, telephones. How much clothing is consumed annually? Food is consumed annually, fuel is used annually. It all represents tremendous, endless amounts of money. If we ever get close to running out, I promise you like I said earlier, they'll print some more. Get over the idea there's a scarcity of money, because there is not. There's plenty of money to go around. There's plenty for you. You go take a couple million dollars-let's say $10 million-out of the world economy, nobody's going to know you even exist. If you start looking for prosperity and you start looking for abundance, and you start looking for wealth, you'll see it exists everywhere. Many of the best, the highest paid salespeople that I have ever met in my years of being around salespeople, are the most generous people I have ever met. Why are they generous? It's not just that they're nice people. No. They're generous because they're not stressed about money, because they know there's no shortage, and because they know they don't possess money. They use money. They know that money is constantly in circulation and all they have to do is collect it. Are you wondering how you collect money? By producing. Because these people know how to produce and because they don't have a problem with limits, they don't have trouble getting money. Look, if you won't spend it, if you won't use it, if you won't even at times waste it, you're never going to have it. Money is plentiful, it's abundant, and there's no scarcity. 2."

    "text": "Second Sale How about learning a way to turn your income up 25% without ever selling an additional product? Does that sound good? Think back on all the times you've been shopping for products. You would look forever. Have you ever been to a store and you look forever, you can't find anything, look a little longer, and then you find one thing? The next thing you know, you make another round in that store or mall, and you start finding other things you can buy. Have you ever had this experience? This phenomenon is common among decision makers and consumers. There's something about the flow. It takes a little while to start but once the flow begins, the flow, the money, the decision-once that begins- the buyer becomes more open to making more purchases. The consumer, the individual, or the decision maker does so because he or she uses the second purchase to follow up the original purchase; because the second purchase basically supports the rightness of the first decision. Once you clue into this, you're going to see it everywhere. I'll give you some examples. Go down to Beverly Hills. Show me one woman walking Rodeo Drive carrying just one shopping bag. If you can show me that, I'll be shocked. Instead, you're going to see a second bag, a third bag, a fourth bag. You're going to see a second item, a third item, a fourth item. Why? They're using second, third, and fourth items to support that first purchase. Here's what you do. Wait until the first deal is either completely consummated or right at the point where you're going to cash out the transaction. Right at that point, you want to ask, \u201cHey, would you consider adding, going up to the next level? It only costs you another...\u201d You don't want to do it before the sale is confirmed. You want to do it right before everything is completed. Timing is everything here. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Second money, it's scary at first because you've never done it. But once you get it down, second money is easier to get than any money you will ever make in your lifetime. People are going to tell you, \u201cDon't be greedy. Don't complicate the close. Don't confuse people. Finish it and get out.\u201d Don't listen! You can't blow a deal like this. All you can do is add value. This kind of little thinking is for mediocre sales people, not for great salespeople. You're using this program not to just understand selling, you want to be great, a master. Second money is for those people who want to take their game to that next income level. You want to do it in half the time, not twice the time. All you have to do is unlock the door to the second money. Get over your fear of blowing the deal and go for it. 3. The People Business, not the \u201cX\u201d Business When someone asks you what business you're in, what do you say? Well, it's not your industry. You're not in the software business, the real estate business, or the car business. First and foremost, you're in the people business. The manufacturers might be pushing product awareness and product knowledge because they believe the weakness of the salesforce is product knowledge, but in reality, the weakness of all salespeople starts with people skills. There are sales people who understood every in and out of the product, every detail, but couldn't close the door of a refrigerator. Why? Because these were product experts and hadn't become people experts. Again, you're in the people business, no matter what your job is. You could be selling products on the internet and you are still in the people business. Your communication still needs to relate to people; so it's product second, people first. Most salespeople spend way too much time selling the product and forget that selling is 80% people, 20% product. The reality is this, people buy inferior products every minute of every day. Why? Because people buy for reasons other than just the benefits of the product. We all have people we patronize not because their prices are great, but because they get that they're in the people business. It's the gas station you choose because the owner greets you by name, cleans your windshields for free, gives you a bottle of water for free, knows your dogs by their names. You don't go there for the greater quality of the fuel. You don't go there because it's cheaper. You go there because he takes care of you. Is he in the people business or the gas business? See, this owner understands that he's not in the fuel business, he is in the people business. So, what is important to your buyers? What do they need? What is their ideal scene? Ideal scene means the perfect scene. What is it they're trying to accomplish with a purchase? What is it that really makes them feel good? If they could get everything they wanted, what would that be? These are questions that will let you know how to sell them. This puts you back into the people business and not just in the product business. When buyers go out looking for a product, they don't care how much you know about the product, they don't care how smart you are. They care about what? Themselves, their time, their money, and that they're doing the right thing for themselves. You and your product are way down on the list. Your selling process, your approach, and how you speak to people need to be focused on what they want, not just what your organization wants. Remember, you're in the people business, not the business you thought you were in. 4."

    "text": "The Most Interesting Person in the World There's an old saying that goes, \u201cI may not be the most interesting person, but I am the one I'm most interested in.\u201d People are far more concerned-and more interested- in themselves, their family, and doing the right thing than they are in having another product, no matter how much they need or want that product. Be more interested in the customer-the person in front of you-than you are in yourself, your sales process, your product, or even your commission, and I promise you, if it's genuine, you'll make more sales. 90% of all salespeople do not take the time to ask enough questions and then truly listen to the buyer to find out what they really want. Right now, I'm not communicating; I'm talking. I'm giving you a lot of information. That's not communication. Communication requires an exchange of ideas. So if I asked you a question: \u201cHey what color do you like the most?\u201d For it to be communication, I need to get you to understand the question and give me a color. Finding out what is most important to people, so you can identify what they actually want-and then you deliver it-requires you ask questions and then listen. You have to listen. What do people find value in? What is important to them? Why is it important? How do they want that communicated to them? You have to find what's important to them. Then you have to listen. And only then can you possibly present, demonstrate, and sell. If you don't get into communication, you never have a chance of making a sale. In sales, we're interested in communication that gives access to data, information, which then can be turned into action. To gain information means your communication should include lots of questions. \u201cWhat do you want this product to do for you that your present one doesn't do for you?\u201d Great question! \u201cWhat would your present product have to do, so that you would be satisfied with it and not have to replace it?\u201d \u201cOn a scale from one to ten, how would you rate what you're using now? Oh really? What would make it a ten?\u201d These open-ended questions are great; they show interest in the customer, and then you're able to discover what the buyer wants, needs, and then can assign value to it."

# RAG Refactoring Plan for LlamaIndex Script

This document outlines a plan to refactor your current LlamaIndex Python script to make it more robust and production-ready, following the official [LlamaIndex RAG pipeline stages](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/understanding/rag/) and best practices.

---

## RAG Pipeline Stages & Script Alignment

### 1. **Loading**
- **Current:** Loads PDFs from a directory using `PyMuPDFReader`.
- **Best Practice:**  
  - Support multiple data sources (PDF, CSV, DB, API, etc.) via connectors (see [LlamaHub](https://llamahub.ai/)).
  - Validate input files and handle errors gracefully.
  - Modularize loading logic for extensibility.

### 2. **Indexing**
- **Current:** Chunks documents into nodes and creates embeddings with Cohere.
- **Best Practice:**  
  - Allow configurable chunking strategies and embedding models.
  - Track and store metadata (source, timestamps).
  - Log/validate node creation and embedding steps.

### 3. **Storing**
- **Current:** Persists nodes to MongoDB and Weaviate vector store.
- **Best Practice:**  
  - Ensure atomic/batch writes to storage backends.
  - Add error handling for DB/network failures.
  - Support reloading from storage for cold starts.
  - Persist both index and metadata.

### 4. **Querying**
- **Current:** Uses Anthropic LLM and query engine to answer questions.
- **Best Practice:**  
  - Modularize retriever and query engine setup.
  - Support multi-step/hybrid queries.
  - Log queries and responses for audit/evaluation.
  - Allow for custom retrievers and response synthesizers.

### 5. **Evaluation**
- **Current:** No explicit evaluation.
- **Best Practice:**  
  - Add evaluation routines (accuracy, latency, faithfulness).
  - Log metrics and errors.
  - Optionally integrate with external evaluation tools.

---

## Key Concepts to Integrate

- **Documents & Nodes:** Ensure clear separation and metadata tracking.
- **Connectors:** Make data ingestion extensible and configurable.
- **Indexes & Embeddings:** Support multiple models and index types.
- **Retrievers & Synthesizers:** Modularize for easy swapping and experimentation.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Add throughout all stages for reliability.

---

## Interim Refactoring Recommendations

1. **Modularize Each Stage:**  
   - Functions or classes for loading, indexing, storing, querying, and evaluation.
2. **Configurable Pipeline:**  
   - Use config files or environment variables for all settings.
3. **Extensible Data Sources:**  
   - Abstract data loading to support more connectors.
4. **Robust Error Handling:**  
   - Try/except and logging at every stage.
5. **Resource Management:**  
   - Ensure all clients/connections are closed.
6. **Evaluation Hooks:**  
   - Add basic metrics and logging for queries.

---

## Next Steps

- Design a modular pipeline with clear separation for each RAG stage.
- Implement configuration management (YAML, TOML, or environment variables).
- Add logging and error handling.
- Prepare for extensibility (e.g., support for new data sources or models).
- Integrate basic evaluation and monitoring.

## Focused Analysis: Indexing Stage â€“ Chunking Strategies

Chunking is the process of splitting documents into smaller, manageable pieces (nodes) for embedding and retrieval. The choice of chunking strategy can significantly affect retrieval quality and downstream LLM performance.

### Available Chunking Methods (Tweaks/Levers):

1. **Sentence-Based Chunking**
   - **Tool:** `SentenceSplitter`
   - **Levers:**  
     - `chunk_size`: Number of characters or tokens per chunk.
     - `chunk_overlap`: Overlap between consecutive chunks (helps with context continuity).
   - **Use Case:** Natural language documents, where sentence boundaries matter.

2. **Token-Based Chunking**
   - **Tool:** `TokenTextSplitter`
   - **Levers:**  
     - `chunk_size`: Number of tokens per chunk.
     - `chunk_overlap`: Overlap in tokens.
   - **Use Case:** When you want precise control over token count (important for LLM context windows).

3. **Paragraph-Based Chunking**
   - **Tool:** `ParagraphSplitter`
   - **Levers:**  
     - `chunk_size`: Number of paragraphs per chunk.
     - `chunk_overlap`: Overlap in paragraphs.
   - **Use Case:** Structured documents, reports, or when paragraphs are logical units.

4. **Custom Chunking**
   - **Tool:** Implement your own splitter by subclassing `NodeParser`.
   - **Levers:**  
     - Custom logic based on domain (e.g., code blocks, sections, headings).
   - **Use Case:** Highly specialized documents (e.g., legal, scientific, code).

5. **Hybrid Strategies**
   - Combine multiple splitters (e.g., sentence + paragraph) in a pipeline.
   - **Levers:**  
     - Order and configuration of splitters.

### How to Choose/Tweak Chunking

- **Chunk Size:**  
  - Larger chunks = more context, but risk exceeding LLM context window.
  - Smaller chunks = finer retrieval, but may lose context.
- **Overlap:**  
  - More overlap = better context continuity, but increases storage and retrieval cost.
- **Domain-Specific Needs:**  
  - For code, split by function/class.
  - For legal, split by section/article.
